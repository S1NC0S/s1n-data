I'm not going to give up the only chance! I'm going out there right now!\"","interrogation1":"Letta sleepwalks to the gate of the MBCC and is taken into custody without issue or complaint. A short while later, she receives a letter from her parents stating that they were aware she had become a Sinner and so became stricter in order to protect her from the world. They believe that the MBCC will be the safest place for her, and remind her to follow the ‚ÄúGrowth Plan‚Äù for her life that they had laid out for her. Letta tells the Chief that her parents‚Äô high expectations for her as their heiress caused her to be isolated from the outside world and never allowed to experience things outside home and school. One night, during a Mania attack that distracted the household, she took the opportunity to sneak out. She was attacked by Corruptors and awakened as a Sinner, but managed to escape as her newfound ability led her home safely. After that, she regularly used her ability to leave home, prankish people and leading them out of the fog, creating the urban legend of The Lantern Ghost of Sloane Street. Ultimately, she ‚Äúsleepwalked‚Äù to the Bureay in order to get away from her parents‚Äô authority for good.\n\nLetta tells the Chief that she plans on experiencing all the things she never got to see before, and produces a list of urban legends that she wants to investigate. The Chief, realizing that Letta can easily escape and go on her own if she wants to, tries to prevent that becoming a problem and agrees to accompany Letta on her adventure.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Through this letter, you learned of the existence of the// Growth Plan, //and in the process, you found out the truth about the \"Lantern Ghost of Sloane Street\".\nAnd Letta, who has left home of her own accord, can't wait to embark on an adventure of her own. You had to agree to go with her.</i></p>","interrogation2":"The Chief and Letta set out to experience the four urban legends on her list. The first one, the field of ever-blooming flowers, is located in a small suburban park. The Chief pays for them to enter, but a gust of wind reveals that the unseasonably blooming flowers are actually made of paper; a staff member confesses that he was spreading the rumor to make money so that he could afford to plant real flowers. The second legend, the steel maze of the roaring monster, appears at night on an industrial rooftop. The roar begins and they pursue its source through the maze. Letta uses her ability to transport them through a locked door and into the factory, where a group of workers accuses them of being industrial spies from another company; they work late at night to avoid being detected by their competition. The Chief escapes by claiming to be an inspector responding to Letta's noise disturbance complaint. Their third legend is the midnight phantom ball, which turns out to be a masquerade hosted by a club that runs supernatural-themed events. With each of their first three investigations having quickly dispelled the myths, the Chief worries that Letta will be disappointed with her adventure. However, she is just as entertained by the reality behind the stories as she was with the legends themselves, and they continue together to the final destination on her list.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>After a series of oopsises about fake flowers in the garden, mistakenly entering a factory, and misplace confidence in an ad, you expected Letta to be lost and sad, but she remained enthusiastic, and said she had no regrets about her choice.\nTo bring the adventure to a successful conclusion, you decide to continue to the last location.</i></p>","interrogation3":"The final adventure on Letta's list is the \"eerie castle of doom and mystery\". They meet a trio who are part of an outdoor adventure club, and agree to explore the abandoned building together. They look through the entire castle, but find nothing aside from an abandoned residential building. Disappointed, one of the adventurers accidentally drops his candle and sets fire to the building. Letta tries to rescue them by bringing them through the walls, but the revelation that she is a Sinner causes her new friends to recoil in horror. The Chief reproaches them scathingly, reminding them that the choice is between accepting Letta's help and burning to death. They give Letta the choice whether to help them regardless; she is conflicted, but she reluctantly decides to allow them to follow her even despite their prejudice.\n\nOn their way back to the Bureau, the Chief asks Letta how she feels about her decision to leave home now that she's seen some of the consequences of her independence. Letta admits that her parents are probably right that she doesn't have very good judgement, but she is determined to keep the freedom to make her own choices.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Adventure is supposed to come with all sorts of surprises and scares: narrow hallways can turn into flames, new friends can be vicious... You never know what's going to happen next.\nBut none of this will shake Letta's desire for independence. You hand her the freedom to make independent choices, and she chooses to continue practicing her Growth Plan.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"The subject voluntarily appeared in front of the Bureau one night, in a \"sleepwalking state\" then, she didn't resist the arrest and was therefore detained smoothly.","arrestRec2":"Her parents once tailored a personal //Growth Plan// for her and required her to strictly follow it. The plan was adjusted annually according to her progress in school, but she herself had no say in it. She had repeatedly suggested adding outings to the plan in vain.","arrestRec3":"The subject is discontented with her frightening image in the urban legend. She claims to have never harmed any pedestrians in the fog with her power but simply tried a few practical jokes, including but not limited to following them with the lantern, tapping them on the shoulder, and appearing suddenly from the wall, etc.","arrestRec4":"The subject owns a self-edited //DisCity Adventure Journal// that records various strange attractions in DisCity gathered from the internet, magazines, and urban legends, accompanied by detailed guides. Field visits have later proven most descriptions to be inaccurate, but she doesn't seem to regret her selection of locations.","servingTerm1":"Ever since her detention, //paranormal activities// have begun to be observed in the Bureau.

As the clinic's head nurse, the subject collected and froze the remains of Mania patients without the patients' permission. Associated with the incident the subject was involved in years ago--the alleged loss of a high-risk contaminant source at the Eastside-Syndicate isolation site--the subject was judged to have a high Mania transmission risk and needed to be in targeted control.\n\n--\n\nWhile she worked at the //SALVA Hospital//, the subject mainly provided auxiliary medical care. She preserved the Mania patients' bodies in the hope of searching for a cure and she never took part in any illegal activity.\n\nOther allegations against the subject have been proven untrue. During the Syndican quarantine point incident, the subject's power awakened when she was treating a patient. She was hence not infected and her special power doesn't come with a risk of infection.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\n\r\nAble to change fluid's chemical properties and gives drugs in syringes better healing effect according to the patient's needs.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\n\r\nRecently awakened.

The mental erosion symptoms may be suppressed through subjective strong mental power.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Even if there is only a tiny sliver of hope, I won't give up.\"","interrogation1":"Anne, though exhausted and on guard after the events of SALVA Chaos, readily tells the Chief about her awakening as a Sinner. She explains that the Corruptor corpses in the SALVA basement belong to the 89 people who died alongside her while treating a Syndican Mania outbreak, and that her awakening was what allowed her to live on the sole survivor. She asks that SALVA be allowed to stay open and states that the crimes committed there were hers alone. When the Chief asks her why she kept the bodies after she knew they were dead, she tries to dismiss it as symptoms of her Mania, but as the Chief reads out the logs she kept on their condition over the years, Anne snaps and snatches the notebook away from them. When asked if she believes she can bring the corpses back from the dead, Anne goes silent. She exclaims that she has been hearing their voices, pleading for her help even after all this time, and refuses to accept that it might be a Mania hallucination. The Chief tries to dismiss it, but Anne remains adamant, saying that Iron allowed her to keep the corpses because she also heard their voices. She says that having given them all hope in their final moments, she can't let them down again.\n\nThe Chief then reveals the true purpose of the interrogation: the MBCC received orders from the FAC to dispose of the remains. Anne seems on the verge of tears, asking if the Chief supports the removal. Although the Chief treads carefully through their next words, Anne still likens the Chief to the FAC troops who cut off her and the others from survival. Despondent, she walks out of the interrogation room as if in a daze. She mumbles about protecting Paige, the youngest and first of the names in her notebook, regarding whom she seems to harbor especially strong feelings of guilt.\n\nWith the Chief alone, Nightingale reaches out over the comm system. The two discuss Anne's reliability and seeming stability over her tenure as head nurse, and the Chief believes that this is a decision that Anne will be able to reach herself. Until then, they will delay the removal with the FAC as long as possible. Before they depart, the Chief remembers the name Paige, thinking that it might be the key to helping Anne move on.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>You couldn't persuade Anne to open the immersion tank. The remains of Corruptors stored beneath SALVA are still a threat. Fortunately, this interrogation wasn't a waste of time because you now understand why Anne is being so stubborn and how she became a Sinner. Having learned Anne's story, you decide to give her time to make up her mind, believing that there will come a day when she opens up her heart to you.</i></p>","interrogation2":"In searching for a Maniac around Paige's age, Nightingale provides the Chief with a case file of a young boy reportedly chased out of Eastside. Despite Nightingale's protests, the Chief goes with Anne alone to the border between Syndicate and the Rust, where they find the boy in question. His condition is dire, showing heavy signs of physical mutation, and Anne offers him painkillers and anesthetics. Instead, the boy asks for sweets, which Anne also carries with her on account treating children in the past. When Anne asks if there's anything else he wants, he says that he wants to go to Eastside. Seeing that Anne is unable to ask the question on her mind, the Chief asks it for her: \"Don't you want to live?\" The boy says he does, but also doesn't have strong hopes in his condition. When reassuring him fails, Anne apologizes for her inability to help, to which the boy says that \"it's boring to live just for the sake of staying alive.\" His words remind Anne of her time treating the outbreak patients, specifically when she asked Paige about her wishes - the girl replied she would be fine with anything as long as she got to stay with Anne. Anne then asks the boy if he really wouldn't blame her if she failed to save him after promising she would, and he nonchalantly reaffirms that he wouldn't.\n \nAnne thanks the Chief, then offers the boy two choices: special medicine designed by her and Iron that would give him another month of life, or a painless death via her syringe gun. The boy chooses the medicine. The Chief is surprised that Anne didn't mention a third option, but Anne seems resolved not to repeat the mistakes of her past. Still, when the Chief agrees to disobey protocol and let the boy go, Anne concocts a plan to have her take the blame for them. The Chief reassures her, then tells the boy that while he can go to the Rust, he has to avoid other humans. The boy gives his name - Gary - and thanks them, telling them to visit Eastside in his stead.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>You found the surviving Maniac boy. Though he's still young, he has his own understanding of life and death. His optimism and carefree nature had a somewhat positive impact on Anne's stubbornness. Although Gary will eventually die inevitably, there were two strangers in his life, helping extend his lifespan by a month, and showing him more of this world.</i></p>","interrogation3":"Hecate confirms with the Chief that Anne has given her approval for the cleanup effort. The two stand before the tank of corpses without her, but Hecate says that Anne instructed her on how to operate the tank, as well as giving her a notebook to pass along to the Chief. It's Anne's patient records, but as the Chief reads, they realize new information has been added to each one: their wishes, including Gary's. In the middle of the notebook is a letter addressed to the Chief. In it, Anne apologizes for all the trouble she may have caused the Chief, confessing that her obsession with bringing her patients back from the dead was a lie she told herself to hide her guilt. As long as she lives, they will live on in her memory. She resolves to continue to researching Mania, believing that the Sinner awakening may hold the key to a cure, and volunteers herself as a human test subject.\n\nFeeling the weight of Anne's words, the Chief leaves Hecate to handle the cleanup, finding Anne stargazing in a secluded corner of the Bureau. Anne recognizes the Chief by their footsteps, musing that Iron's sound like she's always in a hurry; Victoria's are curious, light, and airy; and the Chief's are gentle but firm, confident in their direction, yet conscious of disturbing others. Anne knows the Chief has come to comfort her, but reassures them that she has bid her farewells to the ones she obsessed over for so long. She thanks the Chief, regretting not being able to give them anything in return. The Chief replies that she can repay them with herself, inviting a rare tease from Anne, who seems relaxed and carefree as the Chief blushes over their choice of words.\n\nIn the distance, they hear the rumble of the containment tank's destruction, followed by the smell of the solution in which the bodies were stored. As the two stare up at the sky in solemn silence, they see a meteor, but Anne, voice choking, says that it must be Paige.\n\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Anne finally decided to confront the truth of the Maniacs' death and cooperate with the FAC to clean up the mess. She sent you a letter to tell you all about the thoughts in her mind. Carrying the wishes of the dead, the two of you evermore continue to fight the Mania.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"Due to the SALVA Hospital force, Eastside failed to arrest the subject and handed the subject over to the MBCC for enforcement. The subject defended SALVA Hospital and showed no resistance during the arrest.","arrestRec2":"Born in the Syndicate slums, while parents died nine years ago due to the inability to pay for medical treatment. While parents were ill, the subject was left to take care of the family alone.\r\n","arrestRec3":"Entered Banyan Medical College to study for a nursing degree in Eastside through self-study, and later worked at a first-line Eastside public hospital. The subject's qualification was revoked after the isolation site incident, then the subject was hired by the SALVA Hospital as a head nurse.","arrestRec4":"After the outbreak of contamination at the isolation site, the FAC immediately blocked the news and reached an agreement with the subject to execute all infected patients within a time limit.

This can be slightly useful in Mania Training/story, but it only has one use per battle, and the Sinner is not able to move/attack within this duration. \n - Anne's Ultimate healing is affected by Attack Speed buffs. The higher Anne's Attack speed is, the faster she heals during Ult. \n - Anne can heal summons with her Ult, but her passive heal won't target them. \n - Because Anne's Ult animation is slightly long, if you require immediate healing, make sure to Ult slightly in advance."}],"proConAuthors":["Jiu Jiu subs"],"pros":["Diamond-shaped healing area","Passive heal can target ally anywhere on the map","Can grant invulnerability with ECB","Hardworking, gentle nurse","CN voice is very soothing","Smells like roses"],"cons":["Healing has downtime","Slight delay on burst heal"],"tierlist":{"overall":[{"rank":"D"}],"story":[{"rank":"B"}],"ex":[{"rank":"D"}],"brand":[{"rank":"D"}],"shackled":[{"rank":"D"}],"maiden":[{"rank":"D"}],"toa":[{"rank":"C"}]},"summaryAuthors":["Jiu Jiu subs"],"crimebrandSetsAuthors":["Jiu Jiu subs"],"crimebrandSets":[{"name":"Final Prologue","crimebrands":["final-prologue","final-prologue","final-prologue"],"note":"Increases Anne's healing."},{"name":"Soul Rift + Corridor","crimebrands":["soul-rift","soul-rift","corridor-echo"],"note":"Reduces DEF of enemies that Anne hits with her Normal Attacks."},{"name":"Tuning + Hope + Corridor","crimebrands":["tuning-zero","hope","corridor-echo"],"note":"Provides Anne start-up energy so you can have your first Ult ready quickly.

But after spending much time together, Chief has realized that the subject was active in the violent neighborhood only to make a living. Ever since her detention, she no longer needs to worry for her livelihood and safety, so she's not as deadly as before.\n\nMoreover, the subject has a good rapport with everyone in the Bureau and has adjusted well to life in detention.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThe subject's body cells and nervous system have been influenced by both an unknown drug and her powers, so the muscles and connective tissues recover hundreds of thousand times faster than in a regular person, even massive damage can be healed within seconds.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nThe passive awakening was induced by an unknown drug used during an unethical human experiment.

They read out her criminal record and ask about the evidence of human experimentation that made Hella into a Sinner, but she refuses to answer any questions. Her anger boils over, and Hella yells that if she knew the Chief would lock her up and question her like this, she would never have fought and taken hits for them. The Chief realizes that she had been hoping that they would be different from the previous people who had arrested her, and they apologize and offer to undo her handcuffs, saying that after what they had been through together, the two of them should be more like friends. Hella's anger is ameliorated, but she insists that she doesn't need friends. As a child, gangs would use her as a patsy to escape the Public Security Bureau, and she thought that by doing this for them she could eventually become their friend -- but she has learned better since her so-called friends sold her to PARMA for beer money. There she was experimented on until she awakened as a Sinner, but the researchers were not interested in her regenerative powers. From that point forward, she was used as a punching bag for PARMA's experiments with [[[Ninety-Nine]]]. Still, Hella is proud of the fact that she was able to escape from PARMA after less than a year of being confined there, and happy that her newfound ability made it easy for her to survive back on the streets of [[[Syndicate]]].\n\nThe Chief checks Hella's criminal record again and notes that when she reappeared after her absence, she was accompanied by Ninety-Nine. They make the connection between this new friend and the monster who hurt her so frequently while at PARMA, but Hella shuts down again at this line of questioning. The Chief assures her that they aren't trying to catch Ninety-Nine and just want to keep Hella from being hurt again, but she retorts that the Chief should have kept treating her like a criminal, and that the two of them could never be friends as long as the Chief is constraining her with the [[[Shackles]]].\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nYou discovered several reports about Hella from multiple investigation cases.\nOne of the reports shows that she has a close connection with a test subject in the Laboratory of Parma.\nIt turns out that you are right about Hella. She cares about this subject and even calls her a \"friend\".</i></p>","interrogation2":"[Accessible only after Ninety-Nine's Interrogation]\n\nShortly after the Chief saves Ninety-Nine from execution, Hella escapes from the MBCC, her cell door pushed in by Ninety-Nine -- however, Ninety-Nine herself remains at the Bureau, waiting in Hella's cell. The Chief sends [[[Nightingale]]] to a set of coordinates to recover Hella, then asks Ninety-Nine what Hella is doing. She gives them a taunting note from Hella, and the Chief sets off alone, following the Shackles to where Hella is hiding out -- having intentionally sent Nightingale in the wrong direction. Hella bluffs that she was trying to run away from DisCity, but she easily acquiesces to returning to the Bureau, at least temporarily. The Chief asks if this means that they're now friends, and Hella reluctantly thanks them for helping Ninety-Nine.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nThe fact that Ninety-Nine didn't escape together shows Hella didn't really want to run.\nShe intentionally left behind a message so you would go after her, probably just trying to show you some parts of her \"true\" self.\nMaybe she has recognized you as one of her \"friends\".</i></p>","arrestRec1":"Defeated during a gang shootout on the streets of Syndicate and separated from companions, the subject was arrested by the Bureau and later transferred to the MBCC when the Sinner identity came to light.","arrestRec2":"Investigation suggests that the subject's parents had records of illegal smuggling and were shot to death by an accomplice when the subject was seven years old. It's believed that the incident directly led to the subject's criminal tendency later in life.","arrestRec3":"The subject has a complicated and fickle job history and has been involved in a variety of crimes, including theft, scamming, and smuggling. The subject has also been a member of several gangs but never lasted long in any of them.","arrestRec4":"An experimental subject in the Laboratory of Parma, the subject escaped from the lab with Ninety-Nine's help and severely damaged the lab during the process. The subject lived with Ninety-Nine in Syndicate afterward and made a living by doing illegal deeds. The two of them were later separated during a violent confrontation.","servingTerm1":"Upset about her personal failure during a group escape attempt, the subject initiated several more escape attempts alone within a short time. The attempts to force promotion with her powers all resulted in failures and the subject was imprisoned again.","servingTerm2":"The subject's weapon is a steel water pipe removed from the Bureau when it got attacked. When the incident was over, the subject refused the Bureau's offer to provide a standardized weapon and continued to take part in multiple Black Ring missions using this item. The subject claims that \"it just feels handy.\"","servingTerm3":"Enjoys provoking other Sinners and uses extremely offensive language. The subject has been attacked by other Sinners, but no irreversible damage has been done thanks to her extraordinary recovery ability. Such a unique socializing style has given the subject a bad name, but the subject still manages to keep quite a few friends.","servingTerm4":"Feeling inferior for not having received much education, the subject has begun learning to read with the Chief's help and has been making speedy progress. Lately, the subject is hooked on messaging the Chief with poorly spelled texts.","emotionCheck1":"[Having finished her mission, Hella lies on the floor in your office.]\r\n\r\n**Hella:** Ah, have you prepared any rewards for me?

I think this water pipe is very handy.\n\n**Chief:** In that case... Would you like to consider using a stick?\n\n**Chief:** Something like K.K.'s weapon. Better quality. Stronger durability.\n\n**Hella:** Humph! I don't want to! Are you taking away my freedom to select a weapon of my choice now?\n\n**Hella:** Do Sinners even have basic rights?!\n\n**Chief:** You know that's not what I meant...\n\n**Hella:** Then what do you mean? Why must you insist that I change my weapon?\n\n**Chief:** ...\n\n**Chief:** You can always file a request to change your broken weapon. I just hope that you won't tear down any more water pipes in our Bureau...\n\n**Chief:** The maintenance department has been here seven times to repair the water pipe this month alone.\n\n**Hella:** Ha. What about it? The MBCC can't even afford to repair water pipes? Guess it's finally going broke.\n\n* **Prompt:** The budget is indeed limited.\n* **Prompt:** We should all take care of our public properties.","supervision6":"++* ‚ö†‚ö† Step By Step\n\n//Hella seems to be interested in reading books in the Recreation Area.//\n\n**System Notifications:** Warning!

I did all of them for good reasons, alright?\n\n**Hella:** I did NOT damage the vending machine! I only gave it a slight kick to help the other Sinners get their drinks!\n\n**Hella:** They already paid. Why didn't that ******* machine give them their drinks?!\n\n**Hella:** And I never fought anyone. I saw someone bullying a new Sinner and I couldn't just stand back and watch!\n\n**Hella:** It's a purely heroic act of justice!\n\n**Hella:** Can you blame me for hacking the wifi router? Which idiot made the password so simple?\n\n**Hella:** 123456... Only the dumbest idiots use this kind of password!\n\n* **Prompt:** I set the password.\n\n**Hella:** Oh, did you?

I'm still deciding between two gifts. One is a quick ice pack that may help Ninety-Nine calm down when she goes berserk. The other is a bulk pack of band-aids for whenever she hurts herself.\n\n**Hella:** Which one do you think I should give her? You nosy, busybody Chief?\n\n* **Prompt:** Both.\n * **Hella:** That's right! Both are useful for Ninety-Nine.

She is joined by her friends Mil, a driver who had worked with her on previous seasons before retiring but returned due to excitement for this expedition; Raziel, a young navigator who nervously regrets signing up for this dangerous mission; and Laila, a professor and Tide of Ashes researcher who was her senior in school. The others ask why Marguerite is so fascinated with the Apostles, and she explains that early attempts to study the Tide ended in failure and led to fear in academic circles about continuing the work. But this fear only made her more determined to unravel the mystery, and she believes that the Apostles hold the answers. Marguerite expresses a little doubt about their ability to execute the mission, but the others reassure her and shore up her confidence.\n\n[Phase Two]\n\nWithin the Tide of Ashes, the panicking crew is pursued through the sandstorm by monsters. Their gear, from high tech instruments to a simple compass, are rendered useless by some kind of energy interference. Working on a theory she and Laila developed about the Apostles' movement patterns toward the [[[Black Ring]]], Marguerite successfully directs them to a clear patch where they witness the totality of the enormous mass of dark, humanoid Apostles. Marguerite begins filming, but is interrupted by a vague humanoid voice emanating from the monsters. The Apostles begin to take notice of the crew, and they flee again. After finally escaping from the sandstorm, the crew reviews their work; though Laila was able to acquire enormous amounts of data, Marguerite's camera failed to capture any visual representation of the Apostles' humanoid forms. Despite their narrow escape, the team is determined to return to the Tide of Ashes and continue their research.\n\n[Phase Three]\n\nAmbushed by an unseen Apostle, the crew's off-roader crashes, killing them all except for Marguerite. After regaining consciousness, Marguerite wanders through the wasteland, searching for her companions. She finds mementos of them scattered across the land, while a distant voice speaks to her about the nature of Apostles' existences and her own theories about the ability to communicate with them because of their origin in human consciousness. She ultimately begins to hallucinate having found the other three, but is interrupted by an unfamiliar person. The [[[Guide]]] of the [[[Keylan Expedition]]] appears and takes her back to the team's base camp to treat her injuries.\n\n[Phase Four]\n\nAt the expedition's camp, [[[Vanilla |the mechanic]]] repairs Marguerite's camera but refuses to play along with Marguerite's attempt to interview her. She has more success with [[[Dreya]]] and the captain, but her filming is interrupted as a team returns with one wounded member and another who was abducted by an insectoid monster. Banyan writes the missing person off, but Marguerite runs from the camp to try and rescue them. She is stopped by the mechanic, who challenges her motives, and Marguerite admits that her mission is to study the Apostles, and that she can't stop now that her friends have died in pursuit of her goal. The mechanic warns that her chances of survival alone are zero, but Marguerite shrugs it off and promises to return.\n\nDeep in the jungle, Marguerite discovers a colossal, dimly glowing insect nest. The same distant voice speaks to her again, telling her that the only way to understand the Mantises is to dive into their emotions and embrace their instincts. She tries to focus on their communication, and again begins to hallucinate her dead companions, who act as though Marguerite has been missing. They ask her to come back to them and to stay with them forever, as Marguerite breaks down and cries that she was unable to do anything without their help. \n\nThe [[[chief |Chief's]]] voice breaks through the mirage and reminds Marguerite that her friends a really gone. The false landscape crumbles away as she accepts reality, and Mantis enters her corrupted form, no longer able to understand the Chief's words. Nevertheless, as they give her an old, rusted camera, Mantis remembers how to use it.\n\n//May every lost child in the wilderness\nWitness the eternal truth in destruction//","baseVoicelines":"[Obtain the Sinner]\nYou smell... unfamiliar, different from theirs...

Mantis does too—she's always got this softer edge when she's out touching grass.\n\n**Chief:** Such a perfect afternoon... Hold up, how on earth did Mantis get up that tree?!\n\n**System Notifications:** Today, as you wander by, there's Mantis—suspended from a huge tree, her blade-like legs shining cold and deadly, staring down at some Sinners who are picnicking underneath.\n\n* **Prompt:** Try to evacuate\n * **Chief:** Hang on, I didn't think the cafeteria was doing fries today. Where'd you get those, huh?...\n * **[[[EMP]]]:** Chief's on the move! Everybody, bail out! Time to scatter!\n * **System Notifications:** The rule-breaking Sinners dash off in a hurry, leaving just a picnic blanket flapping in the breeze, and under one corner, a shadow flickers past just for a second.\n * **Prompt:** Go up and check\n * **System Notifications:** You make a move to scope out what that shadow really is, but Mantis beats you to it, agilely diving from the canopy, lunging at the elusive shape.\n * **Mantis:** Missed it... bummer... That was a top-notch source of protein and calcium gone to waste...\n * **Chief:** Seems like that's a rabbit that bolted from the kitchen... Mantis, were you aiming to snag it for a bite?\n * **Mantis:** This is a rare find... You've been working hard... Time to load up on protein and calcium...\n * **Chief:** Thanks for the concern, Mantis. I've been keeping on top of my nutrition, but to put you at ease, let's have rabbit at the cafeteria tonight, my treat. What do you say?\n * **Mantis:** Really?... That's kind of you...\n\n* **Prompt:** Wait and see how things unfold\n * **Chief:** ...\n * **Mantis:** This instant... right now...!\n * **System Notifications:** Mantis springs from the canopy with a speed that's a blur to the eye, zeroing in on the picnic blanket right under the picnicking Sinners.\n * **[[[EMP]]]:** Oh no, no, no!!! I was wrong, so wrong, I never should've charmed those fries out of the kitchen staff! Have mercy, hero!\n * **Chief:** ...Was that the rabbit that got away from the kitchen?\n * **System Notifications:** The Sinners have bolted, and now it's just Mantis, touching down lightly, clutching her catch: a chubby bunny.\n * **Mantis:** This one's for you... it's not often we get this kind of game around here... You've been putting in the effort... You could use the boost of protein and calcium...\n * **Chief:** Thanks, Mantis. Let's bring it back to the cafeteria for the cooks to do their magic, and we'll dig in together.","nameEN":"Mantis","nameKR":"맨티스","nameJP":"マンティス","nameCN":"曼缇斯","namePinyin":"Màntísī","nameRomaji":"Mantīsu","voicelines":[{"Sinner":"Mantis","Tag":"Base","Obtain the Sinner - EN":"You smell... unfamiliar, different from theirs...

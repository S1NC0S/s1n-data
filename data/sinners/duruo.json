The utility from her ECB opens up new options in gameplay, with higher shackles giving her the potential to become a DPS herself. However, with so many great banners during and right after [Ode to Sun], consider Du Ruo as an optional pull.    \n    \n~~Also, waifu.~~"},{"title":"Should you pull for Du Ruo?","text":"If you think her kit looks fun, S0 Du Ruo is a solid choice. Currently, she is the only Sinner who can revive a fallen ally but there isn't any content that demands that ability.    \n    \nTherefore, if you are low on pulls or F2P, we would recommend pulling for S0/S1 Yao first, then S0 Du Ruo only if you have remaining pulls and like her kit.    \n    \n*Our very generalized [Ode to Sun] meta pull recommendation:* **S0 Yao > everything else**.    \n    \nCurrent banners have strong competition. Two months after [Ode to Sun], the S-Rank Bianca will be released to complete the Weakspot team, which looks to be as strong as/stronger than Bleed. OwO is also running on a Directional Arrest, and she's a great S0 Endura.    \n    \nIf you lack Physical units, consider pulling S1 Deren, or buying the S-Rank picker for Dreya. Don't worry too much about missing Deren as Mantis is rerunning on the next banner. Future S-Rank Bianca will be able to cover Physical Damage needs too.    \n    \nS0 OwO is a generally good pick if you can afford it; Directional Arrest pity does not carry over.    \n    \nPull Du Ruo only if you like her kit/character."},{"title":"Which shackles to aim for?","text":"S0 is sufficient for a healer, but S3/S4 are significant boosts to her damage output and allows her to become a damage unit. Moreover she deals Magic Damage, which PTN is sorely lacking for.    \n    \nS1 is not bad if you play Summon team frequently, as Eleven and her summons stack the benefits from Du Ruo's S1.    \n    \nKeep in mind that she cannot corebreak, and the conditions to achieve her full damage numbers at S3/S4 are somewhat niche. Thus, Yao is a stronger meta investment."},{"title":"General gameplay style","text":"Du Ruo's bread and butter is her Ultimate, which places the [Offering] status on an allied Sinner. [Offering] provides healing to allies in a 3x3 range, and also deals damage to all enemies in that range. Her healing is just a little less than Ariel's; that is to say, \"as long as it's not dead, you can probably save it\".    \n    \nHowever, you cannot spam [Offering] on a single Sinner; if [Offering] is applied again on a Sinner who already has it, that Sinner will **instantly die**. More on this in \"Extra Info\" section below.    \n    \nHer ECB revives a fallen ally. Additionally, *Du Ruo's ECB will restore the revived Sinner to their original state at the start of the battle, except for ECB count.* This means Crimebrands like Melodious Belltower, Energy levels, etc will all reset, but the revived Sinner will lose all buffs gained during the battle.    \n    \nECB1 is highly recommended for Du Ruo."},{"title":"Extra info: aka \"How does (Sinner Skill) interact with Du Ruo?\"","text":"- If a Sinner dies with [Offering] on them, it will continue its effect from the spot they died. If they had two stacks of [Offering], each stack will independently continue their full effect. There is a possibility for an interesting strategy here with S4 Du Ruo; S4 grants her two full charges of her Ultimate when an allied Sinner dies, so you could set this up for a burst window, but the efficiency of this needs testing on Global.    \n    \n- Du Ruo's S1 applies to summons, thus it applies to Eleven and Eve, and will snapshot onto any summons.    \n    \n- Things affected by Du Ruo's ECB include, but are not limited to:    \n    \n- Sinners who do something \"at the start of the battle\" will perform it again: e.g. Lady Pearl's [Substitute Stage] disappears when she dies, but if revived she will place it again.    \n    \n- Enfer will reapply her bonus amp from [Horrific Mark] to another Sinner, and if on two different Sinners, both bonus amps will work.    \n    \n- Melodious Belltower crimebrand will activate again for 30 seconds, Skyfall will work again.    \n    \n- Sinners like Coquelic who start with full energy will return with full energy.    \n    \n- Some previous interactions will continue to work: Any Coquelic flowers applied before death will work again after she is revived. Eleven's ECB will also absorb any [Strange Entities] on the field correctly for her damage bonus.    \n    \n- However, Sinners like Hecate and Yao who grant allies bonuses at the start of the battle will not stack that bonus.    \n    \n- Things NOT affected by Du Ruo's ECB: ECB use count will not reset, e.g. Deren will not regain ECB uses after being revived.    \n    \n- Some effects are lost after a Sinner dies and is revived by Du Ruo's ECB: Yao's [Burn] damage bonus applies at the start of the battle, so a revived Thistle/Yanyan will not have the bonus. If Cabernet buffs Dreya and Dreya dies, even if revived instantly, Dreya will no longer have Cabernet's buff."},{"title":"Is Du Ruo worth using at S0?","text":"At S0, Du Ruo brings some useful waveclear alongside her heal. \n\nA level 80 Du Ruo with P1 at Lv 7 deals around 3.6k damage on EX 3-3's Zoya with one Ult, increasing slightly for future casts due to her P2. For comparison, a level 80 Serpent's Lv 7 Ult deals around 2.9k on the same boss. \n\n Du Ruo is a comfort pick that can provide both heal and waveclear. In addition to this, since Du Ruo starts with full energy (2 casts of Ult), you can access her waveclearing abilities right from the start of battle, without waiting or spending Empowers on her."}],"guideMedia":[{"title":"In-Depth Du Ruo Kit Review/Guide","author":"Jiu Jiu subs","id":"H7XoL9zAQeE"}],"media":[{"title":"EN Du Ruo Character Trailer","id":"RadIqihQV_o","author":"Path to Nowhere","authorID":"pathtonowhere"},{"title":"CN Du Ruo Character Trailer","id":"AmHvN6naaxU","author":"Jiu Jiu Subs","authorID":"qwertdwlrma"},{"title":"JP Du Ruo Character Trailer","id":"f7JIRJ3EI5E","author":"無期迷途 [むきめいと] ー公式ー","authorID":"pathtonowherejp"},{"title":"KR Du Ruo Character Trailer","id":"zYjl-hD-BhU","author":"무기미도","authorID":"pathtonowherekr"}],"stats":[{"level":1,"atkSpd":0.75,"block":1,"hp":895,"atk":138,"def":55,"res":56},{"level":90,"atkSpd":0.75,"block":1,"hp":3848,"atk":592,"def":236,"res":240}],"img":{"skill1":"https://utfs.io/f/3c156e0c-1f6c-43f8-a938-1ad06b76bf4a-j1zpse.png","skill2":"https://utfs.io/f/31787831-b25d-453d-952d-3ce8ad52be18-j1zpsd.png","skill3":"https://utfs.io/f/b4d15949-951c-4cf9-b499-af77156dcf1f-j1zpsc.png","skill4":"https://utfs.io/f/fbafec37-c1c7-43ed-97b0-c4902fb199d3-j1zpsb.png","shackles1":"https://utfs.io/f/426b7a55-02ee-4877-8b1f-5c744ee083bf-6fcnsp.png","shackles2":"https://utfs.io/f/2f21dbdc-e571-4622-9312-4f5ccbde6ece-6fcnsq.png","shackles3":"https://utfs.io/f/cb6f9c4b-e376-432c-b2a6-11490bbdb397-6fcnsr.png","shackles4":"https://utfs.io/f/43a930e1-6c79-456e-b3c6-87e6e88d0d5a-6fcnss.png","shackles5":"https://utfs.io/f/36da2ada-aa1b-46da-bb19-122d212f115f-6fcnst.png","thumbnail":"https://utfs.io/f/8353194a-7596-4b84-bca6-0449e7497f25-9fqn0m.png","icon":"https://utfs.io/f/796f6fee-3e74-4532-a75f-df233679a2e0-qid297.png","gallery":"https://i.ibb.co/k2CzmPN/duruo-gallery.png","mugshot":"https://imgur.com/5Y6FIM5.png","interrogation":"https://imgur.com/NMsUF1g.png","mini":"https://utfs.io/f/fc86ec50-c3f4-43c9-b7a9-00c76db6f80e-qifqmh.jpg","base":"https://imgur.com/VEXo2gb.png","phaseup":"https://imgur.com/ohsk4zj.png","ecb":"https://imgur.com/k1mjFNM.png"},"release":"released","summaryAuthors":["Jiu Jiu subs"],"notableShackles":[0,3,4],"recommendedECB":"1 → 3","skillPriority":2134,"skillDistribution":"7797","skillMat":"red","skillRelic":"ravings","phaseMat1":"gel","phaseMat2":"bronze","tierlist":{"overall":[{"rank":"TBA"}],"story":[{"rank":"TBA"}],"ex":[{"rank":"TBA"}],"brand":[{"rank":"TBA"}],"shackled":[{"rank":"TBA"}],"maiden":[{"rank":"TBA"}],"toa":[{"rank":"TBA"}]},"crimebrandSetsAuthors":["EKG","Jiu Jiu subs"],"crimebrandSets":[{"name":"Final Prologue","crimebrands":["final-prologue","final-prologue","final-prologue"],"note":"<b>Support set</b></br>Standard healing output set."},{"name":"Justice + Prologue","crimebrands":["justice","justice","final-prologue"],"note":"<b>Support set</b></br>Buff teams's Attack whenever she ults, as well as increase healing done."},{"name":"Afterglow + Prologue","crimebrands":["afterglow","afterglow","final-prologue"],"note":"<b>Support set</b></br>Boosts nearby allied Sinners' Attack by 10% after Enfer uses Ult.

You're a good kid; you owned up to your mistake.\n * **Prompt:** Tell EMP to be careful not to mistake other people's belongings for her own again\n * **Chief:** Because if you make the same mistake again, you might have to open the pouch to save your life with the treasure inside—assuming you can find it first.\n\n* **Prompt:** Help EMP\n * **Chief:** We'll carry out a thorough search.

Younger Sinners are particularly keen on conversing with her.","interrogation1":"A few days after the conclusion of the Sun Crow's attack on DisCity, a [[[city council |City Councilor]]] contacts the Chief to inform them that Du Ruo has turned back from the Eastian delegation and applied for a visa to reenter DisCity under the pretext that interest in DisCity has surged in Eastia and so she wants to study DisCity's mythology. She has requested to undergo an assessment by the Chief, who will determine whether or not it is safe to allow her into the city; thus, the authorities expect that the Chief find a diplomatic way to refuse her.\n\nIn the interrogation room, the Chief questions Du Ruo as to why she would turn back knowing full well that DisCity will not allow her in its borders again. Du Ruo deflects the question and replies she's asking for the Chief's opinion, not Paradeisos's, and asks whether the Chief wanted her to come back. The Chief deflects in turn, and points out that her application is incredibly flimsy; the envoys could not possibly have brought news back to Eastia so quickly, much less returned to DisCity again in just a few days. Besides, DisCity is a recently-founded immigrant state; it doesn't have its own mythology to study, only the state secrets surrounding things like [[[black ring |Black Rings]]] and [[[hypercube |Hypercubes]]]. At this, Du Ruo shows a rare moment of candor. She tells the Chief that as a child, she questioned why people would worship a being like the Sun Crow that only brought disaster, and refused to accept answers that were rooted in superstition. This began her career as a scholar, but where she always wanted to disprove the myths, she also met others like [[[list of minor characters |Xu]]] who were also non-believers, yet would sacrifice themselves to protect those ignorant beliefs. Du Ruo says that by observing her, she learned that miracles do exist, and that myths are created by real people -- thus, the construction and persistence of DisCity is a mythology in and of itself. What she wants to study is how the people in DisCity view the disasters they've overcome and how they live under the constant threat of Mania.\n\nMoved by this notion, the Chief decides to approve Du Ruo's visa. Knowing that by going against the authorities' wish to see her expelled they are taking on sole responsibility for Du Ruo's actions, they lay down the rule that the purpose of her visit can only be for cultural exchange, that anything related to state secrets or sensitive areas is off limits, and that the Chief must accompany her at all times. The two of them revisit their unanswered questions from before -- whether the Chief wanted Du Ruo to return, and why Du Ruo would lie about returning from Eastia on her application -- but they remain at an impasse, with neither of them willing to divulge the truth.\n\n//Having understood her devotion to mythology, you decide to give the mythologist the trust she deserves.//","interrogation2":"Incensed by the Chief's approval of her visa, the City Council demands that Du Ruo's visit will be monitored by the 9th Agency and accompanied at all times by armed guards. They threaten that she will be forcibly detained if the terms of her entry permit are violated in any way, which makes the Chief fear what they may be planning, but Du Ruo is unbothered by these conditions. Instead, she's amazed at the liveliness and high development level of Eastside, remarking at things impossible for disaster-wracked Eastia like museums and digital billboards, and local subcultures like livestreamers. But after she is sternly reprimanded for such innocent things as wanting to buy souvenirs from a roadside stall or interacting with a passerby on the street, Du Ruo's mood begins to dim and the Chief becomes frustrated with the Council's heavy-handed approach. The Chief suggests to the observing Councilor that they lower their guard and give Du Ruo some more freedom of action in order to observe what she will do with a bit of latitude and try to catch her true motives. Somewhat to their surprise, the Councilor agrees.\n\nLeft to her own devices for a short while, the Chief is surprised to see that Du Ruo is awkward and uncertain amidst the busy city. They bring her to the rooftop of an abandoned building in Syndicate, where she can see the statue of [[[Keylan]]] in [[[Keylan Square]]] from a distance. Du Ruo is awestruck, as she explains that Keylan is revered not only in DisCity but around the world, as a sacred and legendary figure. She had never imagined that she'd be able to see Keylan Square with her own eyes, and laments that she will have to leave before the statue is fully restored. The Chief suggests that she stay in DisCity with them -- revealing their answer to Du Ruo's earlier question -- but she declines. Sunsink City is in dire need of strong Sinners. Instead, she suggests that she could take the Chief back to Eastia. Although they point out that DisCity needs them as much as her home needs her, Du Ruo points out that DisCity doesn't value the Chief -- only their Shackles. She considers Eastia her home because she was born, raised and feels safe and like she belongs there. Her words sting the Chief, who has no past or safe place; DisCity doesn't trust them and is as full of enemies as it is friends. She presses them on how the authorities mistreated the Chief during previous crises, and in response they lash out and Shackle her, reprimanding her for breaking the entry agreement. Chagrined by the Chief's rebuffal, Du Ruo declares that having seen Keylan Square will have to be enough for her trip, and that she will leave DisCity in three days.\n\nThe next day, [[[Nightingale]]] reports to the Chief that Du Ruo has disappeared, and that some unknown sorcery has hacked into the [[[minos bureau of crisis control |MBCC's]]] database.\n\n//Du Ruo leaves DisCity without any warning. Meanwhile, the Bureau's database is invaded. Your newly minted trust for Du Ruo is being challenged by the harsh reality.//","servingTerm4":"Before returning to Eastia, the subject gifted Chief an unfinished copy of <i>DisCity Mythical Notes</i>. She claimed that she would continue writing the book when she was reunited with Chief and that it would be a never-ending story.","interrogation3":"The Chief and the [[[framework against catastrophe |FAC]]] pursue Du Ruo through [[[WhiteSands]]], but she leads them into a quicksand trap that disables their sand cruiser. When the Chief comes to, they are in a tent in the desert, being treated by Du Ruo. They wonder what the point of all this has been and warn that if she doesn't return now there will be huge diplomatic consequences, but she plays coy and expresses eagerness to see which is really stronger between DisCity's technology and her own mystic arts to prevent detection. She again tries to convince the Chief to return with her to Eastia, revealing that all she has done is for their sake, to try and free them from the authorities that mistreat them in DisCity. The Chief is moved by this revelation but, feeling the pull of their Sinners searching for them in the desert, they explain to her that they want to stay where the people they care about are, even if they can't call it a home. Du Ruo disagrees with their decision, but she respects their judgement and ends the concealing sorcery. Moments later, they are found by the FAC. Du Ruo invents a lie that she was pursuing an Eastian traitor who had performed the database breach and then fled the city, and the Chief quickly covers for her.\n\n//Underneath the fake academic exchange and the database attack, her purpose has always been the same from the beginning: She has come to verify your situation and to take you away. You cannot leave DisCity behind, nor can you reciprocate Du Ruo's kindness. Pretending as if nothing has happened is the best you can do now.//","interrogation4":"A day after returning from Whitesands, the Chief receives confirmation that Du Ruo will indeed leave the next day. They ask her to stay for a little longer, but when she asks why the Chief would want that, they have no response. They are interrupted, and the moment passes. The Chief says that they will make arrangements that will allow her to revisit DisCity whenever she wants to, and Du Ruo replies that she thinks her work as a mythologist will bring her back often. She gives the Chief a book containing the first draft of her myth about DisCity. It includes her failed attempt to take the Chief away, and ends with an acknowledgement that she could never pull them from their duty.\n\n//Du Ruo leaves DisCity.

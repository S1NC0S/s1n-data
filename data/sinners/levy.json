Levy is suspected of involvement in dozens of cases of business fraud or unfair competition, indirectly causing the death of a dozen people, who have committed suicide after going bankrupt, seeing their families fall apart, or some other tragedy.\n\n--\n\nAs a famous rich heir in Eastside, the subject still keeps his high-profile, absurd style after his arrest. He often describes the Sinners in the Bureau as //boring// during his consultation with the psychologist. Although his nature is impossible to change and he still occasionally harasses staff and advertises products without permission, the MBCC's strictly supervised environment has made it difficult for him to continue his business fraud activity in the Bureau.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThe subject can form a mutual contract with any living being. Once the contract is established, the subject can drain the life and energy from the other party. The subject calls that //reasonable exploitation within the bounds of the contract//.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nAccording to Levy himself, he awakened his power and became a Sinner four years ago, when he experienced \"indescribable joy and satisfaction\" upon revenging himself by every possible means on his relatives who \"had abandoned him\".\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nLevy suffers from a low level of Maniac corruption, but no abnormalities have been found on his body. Psychologically speaking, Levy has been found to be a man of low moral standards who is almost entirely devoid of any sense of guilt and has antisocial tendencies.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Your factory and land are mine now. In return, your little secret will never be exposed again.\"\n\"A pretty fair trade, no?\"\n","interrogation1":"At a company board meeting, Levy ridiculed his cousin and demands a payment of millions of DisCoins. Chad, his cousin‚Äôs son and Levy‚Äôs nephew, attempts to stick up for his father, and Levy mockingly goads him further, causing Chad to hit him. Levy‚Äôs arm is broken and he and Chad are both arrested in the ensuing fight. When it is discovered that Levy is a Sinner, he is transferred to the MBCC.\n\nThe Chief questions Levy about how a normal teenage boy was able to break the arm of an Endura Sinner, but Levy denies that happened and claims that he broke his arm by falling on it himself. He is dismissive of the issue‚Äôs seriousness until the Chief reveals that Chad was found to be carrying a gun when he was arrested, and that he easily could have shot Levy instead if he had been further provoked. This information shocks Levy, and he insists that he be allowed to speak with his nephew so he can help keep Chad from going down the wrong path; he believes that Chad‚Äôs father put him up to shooting him because of their financial feud. The Chief is skeptical of Levy‚Äôs motives, suspecting that he might be looking for revenge against his nephew, but agrees to allow a meeting.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nLevy claims that the culprit of the incident is his cousin and insists on visitng his nephew Chad, his assailant, in the jail in Eastside.</i></p>","interrogation2":"In an Eastside detention center, Levy and the Chief meet Neil, one of Levy‚Äôs former friends. Although he was also the son of billionaires, he lost everything when his parents‚Äô company went bankrupt and is now working as a simple prison guard. Levy still treats him as a friend, but the Chief can see that Neil hates and resents him, and they correctly surmise that Levy was partially responsible for their bankruptcy.\n\nThey meet with Chad, who confirms Levy‚Äôs suspicions that Chad was put up to the attack by his father. To the Chief‚Äôs surprise, Levy treats his nephew kindly and gently, acting the role of a supportive uncle. They come to a settlement and resolve the brawling case, and Chad is released to be brought home by Levy.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nYou've managed to get Chad out despite the mild obstacles. Levy heaves like a genuinely caring uncle with his nephew throughout. This surprises you. </i></p>","interrogation3":"The three return to Chad‚Äôs home in a wealthy neighborhood of Eastside. But when they arrive, they find that the house has burned to the ground. While Chad and the Chief are in shock, Levy suddenly turns on his nephew, explaining that Chad‚Äôs father had fled the city a few days prior to avoid punishment for having embezzled millions from Levy‚Äôs company. Levy had their home burned so that he would be able to sell the property and recoup some of his stolen losses. He mocks the boy‚Äôs pain at realizing both his father and his uncle are scum. While the Chief tries vainly to comfort Chad, Levy walks away, laughing.\n\nThe Chief catches up with Levy and confronts him about his motivation for ruining Chad. Levy explains that he needed to make an example of the boy to prevent anybody else from thinking they could exploit him, but that above all else, he thought it was fun to see how much he could take away from Chad in just a few days. The Chief refutes this though, pointing out how Levy has repeatedly claimed that Chad is just like a younger version of him. They believe that Levy is trying to teach Chad a difficult lesson about what Levy believes is the only way to survive: trust nobody, do everything you want and everything for yourself. Levy agrees to face the consequences of his crimes, and the Chief likens their role to being the uncle who now has to teach Levy a harsh lesson.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nLevy has deceived you. Everything was just his //fun plan//. But you expose his disguise. Levy isn't really indifferent to anything like he pretends to be. A true nihilist won't meddle with things like this. Perhaps he just needs a little bit of care and love. These are the things he never received from his //family// in the past. </i></p>","arrestRec1":"Levy crosses paths with the MBCC for the first time during Special Operation [Data deleted], and his identity as a Sinner is exposed in the operation. Two days after the operation, he is arrested by the MBCC's field workers without resistance.","arrestRec2":"Levy was born into a wealthy family in Eastside. According to those who knew the family, Levy's parents were cold toward each other, and he didn't grow up in a loving household. From age 10 to age 16, Levy goofed around with some of his unemployed relatives, living an extravagant, preposterous lifestyle. And his parents simply turned a blind eye.","arrestRec3":"In N.F. 104, Levy's parents were killed in a car accident. Since Levy was too young to take care of his parents' assets, a so-called //committee of the bereaved// comprised exclusively of Levy's relatives was established to take charge of these assets, which were then divided up among the members of the committee. When Levy came of age, he received less than 8% of what he was entitled to.","arrestRec4":"In N.F. 106, the cracks in the relationships between Levy's relatives began to show. The rifts among the board members were deepening, often leading to bloodshed. By N.F. 110, all the members of the //committee of the bereaved// had fallen out of the public eye‚Äîsome had committed suicide, some had been murdered, and some had gone bankrupt. Levy now possesses 69.1% of the company's shares, taking back control over his parents' assets.","servingTerm1":"As a rule, Levy doesn't turn down the jobs the MBCC asks him to do. But most of the time, he outsources them. Since there's no guarantee that the people Levy outsources the jobs to will complete them satisfactorily, how fast they will be finished, how well, and how completely fluctuate greatly.","servingTerm2":"Levy harries the MBCC staffers every now and then. According to some of the victims, Levy \"strikes up a conversation in an awkward manner,\" and the conversation always ends in him trying to sell the garbage his companies are making. But strangely, he steers clear of the Sinners whenever possible. \"Too many lunatics among them. It's too risky. Doesn't worth it,\" Levy once allegedly explained.","servingTerm3":"Levy is fun-loving. He proposes on more than one occasion that he fund the establishment of some recreation center within the MBCC, like a bar with music, a room for playing bridge, an amusement arcade, a zoo, and a flea market. All his proposals are vetoed in the end.","servingTerm4":"Levy has the habit of launching into farcical hours-long nonsense while sweet-talking his interlocutor into buying his products or signing a business contract full of loopholes. But he takes a completely different attitude when it comes to the Chief; in their conversations, Levy sometimes makes risky remarks.

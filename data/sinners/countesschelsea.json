The legitimacy of the subject's peerage inheritance is still largely controversial. There has been multiple charges against her, such as abusing her special power to produce gems while hiding her Sinner identity and intentionally disturbing market balance, posing a serious threat to Eastside's economic development.\n\n--\n\nInterrogation reveals that the primary motives behind the subject's crime were her confinement and her pet cat Sitri's murder by the old count. The subject is emotionally stable in her detention and never hesitates to donate to charity events supporting causes such as stray animal adoption and human rights protection.\n\nThe subject's power allows her to produce gems, but under the Bureau's strict supervision, she no longer poses a threat to Eastside's economy and market equilibrium.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nUsing her special power, the subject is able to convert organic matters into hard crystal gems and turn minerals into a leopard named //Sitri// at will, commanding it to execute simple attack and defense orders during battles.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nJudging from the timing the subject began squandering gems, the awakening happened about five to ten years ago. The precise context is to be investigated, but the awakening is suspected to have to do with intense emotional fluctuations.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nAlthough no physical health issues have been detected, gem production consumes a lot of energy and the use of special power can wear out the subject. The subject's eccentric behavior is however unrelated to corruption but only due to the subject's character.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Bury the unbearable past with dazzling gems.\"\n\"From today onwards, I am free.\"","interrogation1":"Brushing off her offer to become her sugar baby, the Chief presents Chelsea with a series of testimonies from others who received similar offers in the past, detailing the psychological trauma caused as a result of her repeated advances. Chelsea insists that she just wanted them to be happy, that she loves them, and adds that she loves the Chief almost as much as Sitri, her favorite cat. The Chief then presents her with several missing persons cases, one of which involves 'an old Count.' At this, Chelsea's demeanor changes suddenly. As the Chief questions her further, she admits to killing him along with the others, and to hiding their bodies by turning them into gem statues. She also admits to bribing the Public Security Bureau to close their investigation, stating that anyone's silence can be bought for the right price.\n\nWhen the Chief asks if her sugar mama offer is another attempt at bribery, Chelsea grows panicked and apologetic, saying that her interest in the Chief is genuine. At that moment, Nightingale interrupts with a threatening call from a city councilor, demanding to apply for Chelsea's bail. After they hang up, Chelsea laughs, amused by this turn of events, and Nightingale pulls the Chief aside to inform them that someone from the council has already arrived, forcing the interrogation to conclude early.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\">\n<i>You have been receiving harassing calls. Things are stressful. Nightingale told you that someone leaked the information on the gem Sinner. As a result, trouble is now at your doorstep.\nSeveral people, including a councilor, demand that you release Chelsea. They promise they'll make all your problems go away using money.\nThis matter won't end easily.</i></p>","interrogation2":"Over the next few days, the Bureau's phone and mailbox are inundated with further threats regarding Chelsea's release. The Chief returns to confront Chelsea, catching the tail end of her phone call with an unknown man promising to help get rid of the Chief for her. Initially annoyed, she claims that the call was just one of the many bootlickers after her money, but despite this, her soon mood lifts. She says that during the days she learned to make jewelry, people would always smile when she gave them gems. The Chief tries to refute the idea that money can always buy happiness, but Chelsea counters them at every turn - that is, until they say that money can't buy 'sincerity from the heart.' Chelsea agrees, but offers an alternative.\r\n\r\nShe shows the Chief a clip from a documentary about her. In it, her master brought her a cat. She named it Sitri, but then abruptly turns the video off before the scene plays out further. She shares how eventually, Chelsea's master recommended her to become the Count's exclusive gem cutter, and her and her master became estranged. Until he died, he would only come to her when he wanted to experience the life of luxury. The Chief asks if after all this, she thinks that her and her sugar babies are truly happy. She replies that while she doesn't know, at the very least, Sitri must be.\r\n\r\nThe Chief departs as Chelsea lapses back into her facade, though she does promise that she'll help them take care of the threatening calls. The Chief realizes that in the frenzy of the last few days, they haven't had any time to check their personal mailbox. Upon reaching it, they are ambushed and knocked unconscious. Meanwhile, Chelsea resumes the documentary, watching a happy Sitri jump into her arms.\r\n\n\n<p style=\"color:white\">\r\n<i>Chelsea, who shared her past stories with you, said that she would intercept everything for you.\r\n\r\nBut when you went outside to check your mail, someone attacked you out of the blue.\r\n\r\nUnconscious, you don't know where you are being taken to.</i>\r\n</p>","interrogation3":"The Chief awakens, drugged, back in Countess' Court, and their kidnapped is revealed to be none other than the councilor who threatened them over the phone. The councilor's men bring in an outraged Chelsea, and the Councilor offers her the Chief as a gift in exchange for getting him the council's top seat. When she refuses, he has one of his subordinates threaten the Chief at knife-point. He offers to shake Chelsea's hand in honor of their newfound collaboration. She agrees, then laughs as she turns him into a gemstone statue, killing him almost instantly.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the councilor's men attempt to flee, but Chelsea kills them all in a rain of gems. She continues, lost in the haze of her rage, until the Chief manages to crawl over to her and use the Shackles to bring her back into awareness. Chelsea drops to the ground, torn between anger, fear, and guilt, but the Chief comforts her. Chelsea breaks down, devastated that she allowed this to happen again, just like when she killed the Count. She says that the Count killed Sitri to force her to obey him, ripping Sitri's heart out right in front of her, putting it in her hand. When she lost herself to her anger, Chelsea says that she felt like she could still feel Sitri's heart warm in her hand, as if it were still beating. As she cries, the Chief assures her they are living proof that she can protect her loved ones. The Chief thanks her, and Chelsea once again offers to be their sugar mama. The Chief replies that instead, they prefer a companion who they could trust to fight alongside them. Despite this, a few days later, Chelsea pays off employees to not bother the Chief about the details of the events in Countess' Court, filling their office with luxuries, and once again inviting them to be her sugar baby.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\">\r\n<i>\r\nGems are beautiful. What's ugly are the jackals that followed the smell and came.\r\n\r\nRather than being her sugar baby, you'd rather fight alongside Chelsea.\r\n\r\nProtecting each other is the best way to keep each other company. </i></p>","arrestRec1":"Wanted and arrested by the Public Security Bureau for being involved in multiple emotional harassment cases and financial disputes.

According to the subject's account, the old Count mutilated and killed Sitri for no reason, which became the primary motive for Chelsea's crime.","arrestRec4":"The victims in the Count's mansion were all turned into gem sculptures and hidden in the underground collection room.

Although, surveillance footage shows that several people within the Bureau seem to be supplying her with expensive everyday products and entertainment items, and some are even hired to provide services such as massage and manicure to her.","servingTerm2":"The subject has strained her eyes by doing long hours of lapidary work in the past and suffers from severe myopia, so she wears contact lenses all the time. When asked why she didn't get surgery to fix her eyesight, she answered that she couldn't trust those surgeries.","servingTerm3":"Asking people whom she likes to be her sugar babies has become her signature behavior. Since most staff and Sinners have received expensive gifts from the subject, everyone tends to just ignore her strange behaviors.","servingTerm4":"Due to her poor eyesight, the subject has not been doing lapidary work for years. But she has picked up her tools and begun practicing again for the Chief. She's made a pair of exquisite smoky quartz handcuffs as a gift for the Chief and claimed that the Chief is her property.

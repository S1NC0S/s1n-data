Over the years, she has been inciting her customers to do evil by offering them discounts, indirectly causing many violent attack cases.\n\n-\n\nSince her admission to the MBCC, the subject has been repeatedly consulting the psychologist in the Bureau. Her file reveals that although her power enables her to forge weapons with human malice, the subject herself has demonstrated a pathological fear of the malice and is often troubled by nightmares. Her previous abnormal behaviors should be attributed to her severe chronic mental illness. She likely requires further consultation and treatment.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThe subject's power allows her to collect malevolent energies and turn them into tangible objects, which she then uses to forge powerful weapons.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nThe subject awakened her power when she was severely traumatized at a young age in the [Data deleted] incident. According to the subject herself, what she's been doing all these years is to prepare for forging a \"deity slaying weapon\" and use it to \"cut away my nightmares and fears.\"\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nThe subject's mental health is on shaky ground, and her moral compass diverges greatly from those of normal people. Her mental status must be monitored closely to preempt any sudden changes in her condition.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Stay away from me... Stay away from me... Stay away from me... Stay away from me...\"\n","interrogation1":"A terrorist attack in Eastside included the use of a bomb which released gas that raises people's [[[mania |M-Value]]]. Investigators at the scene of the crime found that the bomb casing featured the insignia of Mess's workshop, so she is brought in by the Chief for interrogation. Mess is initially uncooperative, but eventually agrees to answer the Chief's questions if they answer some of hers first. She asks if the Chief has somebody they care a lot about in Eastside and if dealing with this incident is actually their job. The Chief answers no to both -- they have no memory of anybody they care that much about, and their official duties only relate to detaining [[[sinner |Sinners]]] and dealing with [[[black ring |Black Rings]]]. Thus Mess points out that the Chief is being jerked around by their superiors and compares them to the weapons she makes. She suggests that with the power of the Shackles and the many Sinners who are loyal to them, the Chief could easily overthrow the authorities and rule [[[DisCity]]]. When the Chief shrugs off her suggestion, Mess is impressed at their ability to resist the malice that surrounds them.\n\nWith her questions out of the way, Mess agrees to cooperate. She denies being connected to the terrorists, but says that she doesn't remember the customer. However, she claims to keep a ledger that tracks all of her commissions -- it is encrypted and hidden at her workshop in Eastside. In order to quickly resolve the case, the Chief agrees to bring her back to the workshop.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nMess has agreed to help the investigation on the condition that she can go back to check her ledger.</i></p>","interrogation2":"Mess brings the Chief back to her Eastside apartment, which is garishly decorated with cutesy themes and innumerable stuffed animals. The Chief is surprised at the decor, but Mess annoyedly insists that there's no contradiction between being a weapon-forging blacksmith and loving cute things. She takes them down to her workshop, where Mess reveals that there is no ledger per say -- rather, she keeps a copy of every weapon she forges as a record. She shows off her past projects, each one of them made for somebody who wanted to use it for ill. The Chief is appalled and questions why Mess would fill their orders when she can see the malice in their intent; Mess replies that first and foremost, she doesn't care what they do with them. But regardless, although their hearts are filled with malice, she knows that most Eastsiders don't have the stomach to follow through on their ideas. She even confides, although she doesn't expect the Chief to understand, that she is trying to forge a weapon capable of defeating a terrible existence that is the source of all human malice, but has not yet been able to produce something that can harm it.\n\nThe Chief brushes off her delusions and presses her about the gas bomb, ultimately using the [[[Shackles]]] to force her to tell them about the customer. His name is Jack Naper, the son of the deputy chief of the Eastside Public Security Bureau. His request was of a type that Mess usually would reject, but she took him on as a customer regardless. The Chief orders the authorities to track Jack down, and Mess betrays that she was already aware he is planning to strike again that night. Not knowing what else she might be hiding, the Chief commands Mess to come with them and stop him.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nMess has tricked you, but in the end she has told the truth under the power of the shackles. Now is not the time to deal with her. But you should probably talk to her after everything's done.</i></p>","interrogation3":"The Chief and Mess track Jack Naper to a rooftop showdown. Jack expresses his boredom with luxurious life in Eastside and disdain with the regular people of the district who think that they have nothing to worry about because of where they live. Mess is irritated by the fact that he's doing all this just for fun, but flippantly refuses the Chief's order to stop him. While the two argue, Jack becomes agitated and threatens to detonate the bomb, but Mess dismissively teases him and claims that he doesn't have the guts to pull the trigger and lose the deterrent that's keeping him from being immediately arrested. Frustrated, the Chief again resorts to the Shackles to force her to act. Mess pulls the malice from Jack's body, and he collapses and is taken into custody.\n\nWhile the Chief begins to wrap up the case, Mess angrily protests that despite all the anger, disappointment and frustration boiling up inside the Chief, none of those emotions ever turned to malice. She reveals that she had planned the entire proceedings, and is upset to have gotten so little to show for it. Suddenly furious, Mess conjures a sinister sword and wildly hacks at the sky until she wears herself out and falls to the ground in tears. She says that the dream where she met the Chief was the only good one she's ever had, as they defeated the Dreadlord there, but nobody can defeat it in real life. She had hoped that if she could harness the Chief's malice, it would be enough to defeat the entity. But despite the Chief's best efforts, they can't detect the presence that Mess says in right in front of them. They try to convince Mess that she can start to rely on them, but Mess laments that she can't be helped by anyone who can't even see her enemy, and wonders if she's really just a lunatic, doomed to suffer alone. Seeing Mess so vulnerable, the Chief is at a loss of how to help her.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nMess has received psychotherapy at MBCC medical department. Though it seems there isn't much going on with her, she was actually tortured for a very long time by despairing fear. As for that \"thing\" she's imagining, whether it actually exists or not is something nobody knows and nobody cares.</i></p>","arrestRec1":" The subject's identity as a Sinner is exposed in the [Data deleted] incident.

She is now living in Eastside, on a sound financial footing. On a commercial street in central Eastside, she owns an independent forge and an independent store, the two places where she spends most of her time.","arrestRec3":"Mess adores Eastside's pop culture, splurging on ornaments, cosmetics, clothing, and Phantom Entertainment dolls.","arrestRec4":"Has been selling weapons she makes to mercenaries, weapon collectors, and others since N.F. 110. She sells a wide range of weapons, from firearms to cold weapons. High-performance and stylish, her weapons are much sought-after, with their prices going higher and higher. Later in her career, Mess also started inciting her customers to cause harm in exchange for a remission of service fees. At the time of her capture, more than twenty people have been injured or died as an indirect result of her actions.","servingTerm1":"Mess is usually more than willing to take on commissions from the MBCC for weapons. \"I'm sure they will be used in battles, so I'm not gonna charge you,\" Mess once said.","servingTerm2":"Mess frequently asks the Supply Office to purchase the latest dolls, clothes, and ornaments on her behalf.

So far, thirteen fights have taken place as a direct result of her meddling. Contact between Mess and the other Sinners should be prohibited, unless it's absolutely necessary. ","servingTerm4":"Recently, Mess has taken a keen interest in the Chief, going to extraordinary lengths to encourage the Chief to hurt other people, but to no avail.

Some even think the real culprit of the incident should in fact be //their record label who has stolen their music//.\n\nThe higher officials have judged the concert stampede case closed. The subject has never shown any severe violent tendency during her detention in the MBCC. For now, the case can be considered solved.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThe music played by the subject has a powerful stunning effect and is not limited by the type of instrument used. Powered, the music can induce adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting and dizziness in the audience.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nAwakened during the concert incident a few years ago. The trigger is believed to be the subject's intense emotional fluctuations during the concert, but the precise cause is still to be determined.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nThe subject is in the incubation period of awakening. No apparent signs detected so far and all indicators appear normal. The abnormal and rebellious behavior is due to the subject's career in rock music and not related to mental corruption.\r\n","ecbFlavourText":"\"Take a good look, you dream-forsaking bastard!\"\n\"This is what Anavrin's music is supposed to sound like! This is what we used to be!\"","arrestRec1":"The Public Security Bureau received reports of a drunken brawl, discovered the involved person's Sinner identity, and transferred the case to the MBCC. As the subject was still drunk at the time, the arrest went smoothly.","arrestRec2":"The subject grew up in a town on the outskirts of Eastside and has parents who belong to the ordinary working class. A fan of the DisCity's rock culture since childhood, the subject went to the prosperous city center of Eastside alone at sixteen to pursue her music dream. Since leaving home, the subject has rare contact with parents.","arrestRec3":"The subject was the guitarist of DisCity's most famous underground band, Anavrin. But after the band's vocalist got shot by a gun during a performance, Anavrin disbanded and became a forgotten legend. Later the subject moved to Syndicate and continued to pursue a career in music as a solo musician.","arrestRec4":"Only two months after the vocalist's murder, the former bassist of Anavrin signed a new contract with Quinn Entertainment, held a concert in the name of a new Anavrin, and rearranged the former band's original songs to make them more pop. These actions enraged the subject and are believed to be the core reasons for the subject's sabotage of the concert.","servingTerm1":"Repeatedly sends requests to the MBCC's logistics department for a venue to run //rehearsals//. Considering the foreseeable noise it'll cause, the logistics department always refuses to process requests of this sort.","servingTerm2":"The subject doesn't show much talent in singing and is even overshadowed by certain amateur Sinners. The subject is however unaware of the fact and often starts humming unidentified tunes out of the blue, resulting in frequent complaints. ","servingTerm3":"Despite not being able to hold liquor, the subject is eloquent and never runs out of stories to tell, and so has known a few drinking buddies within the Bureau. Essentially treating the canteen as a bar, the subject needs only to order a cosmopolitan with lime on the rocks and can then chat away the whole day with other Sinners. ","servingTerm4":"The subject has a pretty solid fan base within the MBCC and the fans have even started a fan club. By the subject's request, the fan number 00001 title has been reserved for the Chief, which comes with the privilege to give song requests for a live guitar solo performance.

  "interrogation1": "Donald arrives unexpectedly at the MBCC, where the Chief finds him helping himself to the cafeteria food and flirting with [[[Ignis]]] and [[[Kelvin]]] while they work in the kitchen. He thanks the Chief for the meal, which the Chief is happy to provide, but they’re correctly assess that Donald wouldn’t have shown up out of the blue without a bigger purpose than that. Donald suggests that find a more private place to talk, and the Chief brings him to the interrogation room.\n\nThey discuss a bounty that Nirvana has placed on Donald’s head, and both agree that as long as he lays low, it is unlikely that they will ever catch up with him. However, Donald is concerned that since the end of BR-002, there are untold thousands of people in Syndicate who are still suffering from low-level Mania contamination, and the West District doesn’t have the resources to treat them. The Chief offers to use their political clout to solicit donations from Eastside to fund treatment, but Donald dismisses this offer, saying that once the new Hypercube trade gets underway, money won’t be a problem. Instead, he’s concerned about the recent influx of carpetbaggers from Eastside, including doctors coming to provide treatment for Mania patients. He reveals that one such patient is his Aunt [[[list of minor characters |Margaret]]], and that she has been abducted by Nirvana under the cover of a group of doctors from [[[banyan medical |Banyan Fourth Hospital]]], a psychiatric hospital in Eastside. Donald asks the Chief for help rescuing her, and puts them in touch with [[[list of minor characters |Das Arz]]], a doctor at Banyan Fourth Hospital whom Donald has history with.\n\n//Donald informed you about the Mania problem that the West District is currently facing, and you learned that his Aunt Margaret was taken away by Banyan Fourth Hospital, a subordinate organization affiliated with Nirvana. You found information about the doctor Donald mentioned and decided to go to the Fourth Hospital as quickly as possible to talk to him in person.//",
  "interrogation2": "To the Chief’s surprise, Donald accompanies them to the hospital, wearing a beaglepuss disguise. He is nevertheless able to convince a nurse that he is the Chief’s bodyguard, and allowed to accompany them to their appointment with Dr. Arz. Along the way, the nurse receives notice of a disturbance with the hospital’s Mania patients, and he leaves Donald the Chief temporarily alone. Psychiatric patients nearby recognize Donald, revealing that he had previously spent time at the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe nurse returns and brings Donald and the Chief to Das Arz. Dr. Arz quickly sees through the Chief’s cover story for being there and confirms that Donald was once one of his patients. He refuses to assist them with their mission to rescue Margaret, but he reveals that she is being held in the same high security ward where Donald was once confined. He also provides the Chief with Donald’s medical records and warns them against interfering with the hospital’s operations, as despite its ties with Nirvana, it remains a legitimate medical facility. The Chief and Donald depart from the hospital, resolved to find a way to get to Margaret.\r\n\r\n//The meeting with Doctor Das didn't go smoothly. Things are proving to be more difficult than previously expected. Fortunately, Doctor Das provided essential information. You and Donald decided to further analyze the situation and make new plans based on the current circumstances.//",
  "interrogation3": "The Chief reads Donald’s medical files and finds that between N.F. 105 and 108, Donald’s severe trauma from the events of BR-002 and his subsequent [[[mark |marking]]] left him with intense schizophrenia, inability to speak, and little ability to respond to the outside world. Despite this, he was also the subject of extensive and brutal experimentation due to his rare status as a docile S-Class Sinner. In N.F. 108, it was determined that he no longer held research value, and Donald was handed over for psychiatric intervention. Donald interrupts and tells the Chief that, despite appearing like a normal part of the Banyan system, the Fourth Hospital is a front for Nirvana to dispose of political threats. Doctors like Das Arz are there to provide cover for the activities taking place beneath the surface. He goes on to explain that after Nirvana tired of experimenting on him, Dr. Arz became his psychiatric therapist. However, Donald’s condition only began to improve after he was found by Samuel and [[[Raven]]], who told him about Julien’s construction of Drifter Camp and the rebirth of Rustfire. He seems breezily unconcerned with the details of the horrors he experienced, so the Chief presses him further, forcing him to confess that he continued to be confined all the way until N.F. 112. However, Donald insists that he is just happy the worst is behind him and sees no point in digging up the details of his past, which prompts the Chief to apologize for their fixation on trying to “reveal the truth.”\r\n\r\nDonald continues to explain that after he met Raven, they decided to spread a false story of his death in order to prevent Rustfire from engaging in a suicide mission to rescue him. Meanwhile, Donald pretended to be insane for years in order to keep Nirvana from suspecting him, but he refrained from trying to escape out of fear of their retaliation against Dr. Arz and his fellow patients. Ultimately, he was released due to an order from the [[[Hush]]] that transferred him to the Reconstruction Executive Committee. Donald and the Chief speculate on why Shalom would have done that, and conclude that Paradeisos and Nirvana must not be perfectly in lockstep. This realization spurs an idea, that if they were to expose (or threaten to expose) the sordid truth of the Fourth Hospital, there would likely not be any consequences from the higher ups.\r\n\r\n//Your late night conversation with Donald yielded surprisingly positive results. Now, you're prepared to confront Banyan Fourth Hospital head-on.//",
  "interrogation4": "Donald and the Chief meet with Jones, the director of the Fourth Hospital. Donald demands that they release Margaret, and Jones counters that they will gladly do so only if Donald takes her place. He admits that Nirvana can’t move openly against the Chief of the MBCC, who is now one of the most politically important people in DisCity, but that Donald also can’t defy them as long as they have Margaret. Donald retorts that Nirvana isn’t the only holding cards, and produces a videotape showing hospital researchers conducting fatal experiments on patients. Jones is furious, but insists that such blackmail can’t harm Nirvana.\r\n\r\nThe Chief counters that that may have been true six months ago, but now, political and business elites are rushing to make alliances within the newly empowered West District. Under pressure Das calls his boss, the Dean of the Banyan Medical system. The Chief proposes to her that in exchange for not revealing the hospital’s dirty secrets, Banyan should transfer the Fourth Hospital’s assets to a new branch hospital for treating Mania in the West District, with Das Arz as its director. The Dean reluctantly agrees, and looks forward to when she will meet the Chief face to face.\r\n\r\nA week later, Donald helps with the construction of the new West District’s Banyan Branch Hospital. Although tired, he expresses satisfaction that his and the Chief’s long hard work is finally showing results. He comments on how a decade ago he was just acting on instinct and fighting his way towards his goals, but now he’s learning as he goes to make deals and find partnerships for West District, and reflects that the modern Syndicate would be the perfect place for Julien. Margaret is released from the hospital, having finished her Mania treatment. She sternly asks Donald where he’s been for the past ten years, before hugging him and finally welcoming him home.\r\n\r\n//A few days after Margaret's discharge, you approved Donald's application for his \"long-term fieldwork.\" After all, West District needs him more than the MBCC does right now. After everything he's been through over the past ten years, this man is once again back to the land he's familiar with, \"giving his all\" for his hometown. It's clear that Donald is satisfied with his current situation. In his own words, \"It's quite romantic.\"//",

The nickname \"Archer Queen of Syndicate\" became a buzz all over town. Gold always glitters, doesn't it?\n\n**Donald:** Looks like the West District never runs out of gifted folks. Surprising to see things still so lively even after I've hung up my hat. But the youngsters, they often can't quite get a handle on their strength, right? It was a long road for me to learn how to hold back.\n\n**EMP:** Yeah, really, when you're too powerful, it's like a double-edged sword—a bit of a high-class headache, huh?\n\n**Chief:** What's going on here?

Getting older really takes its toll, huh? If I were just ten... no, let's say three to five years younger, I wouldn't have messed up...\n * **Chief:** What's with all these patches?\n * **Donald:** Just my battle scars from weathering storms and thunder.

Wow, you're outmaneuvering me at my own game!\n * **Chief:** Otherwise, I wouldn't have spotted your \"badges of honor.\" It puzzled me why you were getting injured so often in training... Why keep the flare-up of old wounds a secret? I could have adjusted your training schedule.\n * **Donald:** Well, I was trying to play it cool, but turns out time is the real slayer.

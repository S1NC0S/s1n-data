Enters the battle with Ultimate Energy fully charged.","maniaIntensifyTitle":"Conquer The Enemy","maniaIntensifyText":"Deals 10% more Damage, and another 10% more for enemies with broken Cores.","criminalRecord":"Oak Casket is an underground information broker who uses Romanesque Hall as a front. She commits brutal murders, and sells classified information she has collected to violent gangs, which has brought about many large conflicts resulting in heavy casualties; she also disrupts the balance of power in Syndicate by using confidential information to stir up frictions between the various factions in the region.\n\nSeveral cases of trafficking are also linked to Oak Casket. It's unclear where she obtained the trafficked products (later on, by her own admission, she obtained some of the products herself). This is a serious crime that has disastrous ramifications, she must be detained immediately.\n\n--\n\nFor a long time, the subject was active in Syndicate as //the only hall manager who could hold a funeral in Syndicate// and made a living with her ability to obtain information from Corruptor remains. But judging from her behavior after her arrest, she seems to have long tired of life around gangsters and looks forward to a change.\n\nCurrently, the subject's conduct in the Bureau is satisfactory. Although she still has an avid interest in death and remains, her obsession is overall still under control.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nOak Casket's power allows her to capture and decode the information that is carried in the electric field and magnetic field created by a newly-dead Maniac's brain and body. How much information she can attain is inversely proportionate to how long the person has been dead.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nOak Casket was infected with Mania and awakened her power in a mass grave somewhere in Syndicate when she was a teenager; she was badly injured, but miraculously survived. As a Sinner, she has the ability to heal her body to a certain degree without any external help, and to attain useful information from newly-dead Maniacs.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nThe test results show that Oak Casket suffers from a moderate level of Maniac corruption. No abnormalities have been found on her body, but when her mind is exposed to certain types of stimulation, she will hallucinate and exhibit other symptoms.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Only when a person has lost their vitality, their foolishness, dullness, and vileness... can be redeemed.\"\n\"Perhaps the same goes for this city.\"","arrestRec1":"The Chief meets Oak Casket in Syndicate during a rescue mission. The Chief first clashes with and then works with her, and at the end of tthe mission, she goes to the MBCC with the Chief of her own volition, and agrees to be detained.","arrestRec2":"Born during the most chaotic period in Syndicate, the subject was adopted by a kind soul at a rescue station and lived with several other children. This rescue station was the precursor to the Romanesque Hall. During this time, because of her introverted personality, she was regarded as an oddity by those around her.","arrestRec3":"At the age of thirteen or fourteen, the rescue station was besieged due to the involvement in gang-related incidents, and the subject was seriously injured in the assault. Barely clinging to life, she was abandoned by her benefactor. From then on, she awakened as a Sinner.","arrestRec4":"Investigations reveal that after being abandoned, the subject became disillusioned with the chaotic situation in Syndicate, believing that there was no hope in the world. After resolving her obsessions with the Chief, her perspective somewhat changed, and she held a funeral for her past self.","servingTerm1":"In the early days of her detention, Oak Casket is passive and cold, with vital signs once being abnormally low. She is then diagnosed with //information input disruption syndrome//, which manifests itself as a passiveness arising from an inability to adjust to a normal environment after a long period of residing in an abnormal environment.","servingTerm2":"After a period of adjustment, Oak Casket starts getting accustomed to her life in detention. She is still passive and cold, and is not performing as well as she should be in battles, but has a tremendous fighting spirit. The MBCC later decides to let Chief include her in as many battles as possible, so as to satisfy her need of extracting information from the newly dead.","servingTerm3":"To further alleviate Oak Casket's passiveness, the MBCC agrees to move her to the room next to Dudu's, and replace the bed in the room with a long, black oak casket. She is doing well at the moment, on the road to recovery, and starts to get along with the other Sinners.","servingTerm4":"Oak Casket's symptoms have been improving thanks to the comforting of Chief and Dudu, and she is returning to the physical status she was back in Syndicate. She is becoming more trusting of Chief, and more willingly to protect Chief in battles; she is not as obsessed as before with seeing those around her dead so that she can extract information from them.","emotionCheck1":"[Oak Casket is lying in a long black box in her room, with a peaceful face.]\r\n\r\n**Oak Casket:** Want to join me for awhile?

That's why I can read it.\n\n**System Notifications:** She reads a line to you in Outland language.\n\n* **Prompt:** Ask the meaning\n\n**Chief:** What does that mean?\n\n**Oak Casket:** The rough translation is like this... Please grant him the perfect rest. May the holy spirit be bathed in eternal light.\n\n**Chief:** It's beautiful. Thanks for explaining it to me.\n\n**System Notifications:** Hearing your response, she chuckles and lifts the corner of her mouth playfully.\n\n**Oak Casket:** Not at all.

It's a very special scent.\n\n**Oak Casket:** This is not perfume, it's vetiver fragrance.\n\n**Oak Casket:** If you like it, I can give you some.\n\n**Chief:** Oh, thank you.\n\n**Chief:** Why do you like this fragrance, by the way?\n\n**Oak Casket:** Vetiver has a warm scent of deep soil and an excellent relaxing property. Use it on your body, and you'll feel comforted and a sense of belonging of returning to the earth.\n\n**Chief:** I see...\n\n**Oak Casket:** Of course, this fragrance has an even more important use. It masks odor very well.\n\n* **Prompt:** Mask odor?\n * **Oak Casket:** It can mask... um... the smell of decay.

This necklace doesn't belong to me.\n\n**Chief:** Hmm? It's not yours?\n\n**Oak Casket:** It belonged to that woman in the photo. She passed away a long time ago.\n\n**Oak Casket:** That old lady was very ill at the time, but she just wouldn't let go of it. Before she passed away, she wanted to know if her son, who left home after a fight with her, did forgive her in the end.\n\n**Oak Casket:** In fact, her son didn't run away from home. He died in a car accident the night the fight happened, but the old lady's family never told her for fear that she couldn't take the bad news.\n\n**Oak Casket:** So I told her the truth.\n\n**Oak Casket:** Do you think I did something wrong?\n\n* **Prompt:** It's wrong\n * **Chief:** On her deathbed, she probably just wanted to hear some comforting words that would make her departure easier.\n * **Oak Casket:** ...I see.\n\n* **Prompt:** It's not wrong\n * **Chief:** False hope and consolation are meaningless. I think what she needed to know was the truth.\n * **Oak Casket:** You think so?

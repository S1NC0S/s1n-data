Worsens Eastside's crime-filled atmosphere as a terrible influence on the city.\n\n--\n\nIt's stated in the file that multiple individuals involved in the illegal gatherings have a history of sexual harassment and assault, which matches the subject's statement. It's believed that after her special power awakened, the subject was unable to leave the fetish club due to the nature of her power, so she was essentially coerced into participation.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThose who get whipped will have their brain activities and hormones controlled. The ability is known to be useless against Macchiato, and can only be used on others.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nOut of self-defense in the face of the boss's blatant harassment, her special power awakened.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nHaving never contracted with the source, she was in an early stage of Mania before the awakening. No visible signs, and no long-term mental damage has been observed.","ecbFlavourText":"\"I think... I'm used to it already.\"","arrestRec1":"A new club suddenly went up the ranks in Eastside, and was investigated by the Bureau for unclear business content. The place was immediately trashed when it was found to be an illegal assembly led by Sinners. Macchiato was arrested for being \"The-One-and-Only Designated Queen of the Club\".","arrestRec2":"Her family was not well-off, and had a lot of kids. After graduating from college, she worked at Eastside Bank as a clerk, sending most of her measly income back to her home.","arrestRec3":"To get a raise, she worked very hard. But her gender and her looks led to a lot of gossip and prejudice, which led to her losing opportunities of promotion. Not only that, but she was also harassed by her male bosses.","arrestRec4":"Her special power awakened when she resisted harassment from her boss, but this unexpectedly brought pleasure to the aggressor. Tempted by the boss's offer to \"conceal her identity as a Sinner\" and \"promote her and give her a raise\", Macchiato reluctantly agrees to work as \"Queen\" at the club he recommended.","servingTerm1":"The subject does not enjoy the act of whipping others. Out of combat, she hides the whip somewhere less obvious. She tried changing weapons, but gave up as no other weapon came close to the efficiency of the whip in using her special powers.","servingTerm2":"Allowed to retain contact with her family in Eastside. She cares a lot about her parents' health and her siblings' academic results, and lied that she was assigned to a faraway branch, keeping them away from the truth.","servingTerm3":"Needs and craves money. When rich Sinners walk past her, her jealousy can be observed. Yet when offered a direct charity, Macchiato would turn down the offer, or make a counter offer where she earns the profit.","servingTerm4":"Holds appreciation for the Chief for releasing her from the club. She may not like being a \"Queen\", but if the Chief requests it, she will gladly oblige. And in that process, she comes to understand the fun of the business.

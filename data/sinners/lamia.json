The society, in name, is an organization for ocean culture enthusiasts, but in fact, they have violated regulations and held offline meetings multiple times.\n\nThe president of the Thaumas Society died unexpectedly in the Insatiable Fiesta incident, which is suspected to be related to the subject. It is recommended to detain the subject immediately and conduct an investigation.\n\n--\n\nThrough investigation and interrogation, it was found that the subject's extreme personality and distorted mindset were caused by unfair treatment and living in a high-pressure closed environment for a long time. She mostly used her special power to hurt others out of self-defense. After the interrogation, the subject began to waver. She acknowledged Chief and gradually began to open up. Recently, Chief has been trying to help the subject re-understand the world and herself, in order to reshape her erroneous concepts.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nIn addition to the ability to breathe underwater, the subject can also use her special power to make enemies hallucinate, lure them into traps she has set up, and then launch a surprise attack.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nThe subject awakened her special power due to a strong desire to survive when her life was threatened during her adoption by distant relatives in her childhood.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nThe subject suffers from a moderate level of corruption.

It contains plenty of information about her role as Ocean Messenger, but nothing about her identity before taking that position. The Chief arranges an interrogation in order to learn more about who Lamia really is. They begin by questioning her about the Thaumas Society, and Lamia recites the publicly available surface information about the group. The Chief then digs into her relationship with the Society's president, and Lamia claims to admire the president and hold nothing but gratitude towards him. She feigns shock when the Chief informs her that the President is dead, but the Chief easily exposes her lie when they reveal that his autopsy showed that he was killed by a Sinner. Lamia changes her story, now claiming that she always believed in the President until she happened to overhear a conversation in which he revealed that the entire purpose of the Society was to exploit their \"Seafarers\" for money. She says that she confronted him at Ogygia Villa and that he decided to kill and replace her, and she fought back accidentally in self defense.\n\nThe Chief turns to the matter of Lamia's past and she claims that she was taken in by the society at a young age and remembers nothing before that. The Chief plays a recording of an old nurse who delivered her, revealing that because of her appearance, she was abandoned by her mother after birth and kicked around until distant relatives were pressured into taking her in. Lamia appears to recoil in pain from the memories, requiring the Chief to use the [[[Shackles]]] to stabilize her. The Chief tells her to get some rest and recover, but before they leave, Lamia tells them that they can learn about her past at Eastside Psychiatric Hospital.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>You finally know the inside story of the Thaumas Society and the hidden truths behind the President's death, but when the topic comes to Lamia's childhood, she suddenly loses control, forcing the interrogation to be suspended.\nAt the same time, she gives you a location—Eastside Psychiatric Hospital. It seems to hide the reason for her loss of control.</i></p>","interrogation2":"On the way to Eastside Psychiatric Hospital, crowds gawk at Lamia passing by, recognizing her as the Ocean Messenger. Lamia brushes it off, saying that she's used to such a thing and is just grateful that they view her with awe rather than disgust. The Chief expected to find information about Lamia herself at the hospital, but their visit brings them to the room of Lamia's cousin instead. As soon as he sees Lamia he is struck with hysterical fear, and she explains that when she was a child, he bullied her by holding her head underwater. Her fear caused her to awaken as a Sinner, and she instinctively lashed out with her hallucinogenic powers. She expresses deep remorse for what happened to him, but the Chief again easily sees through her deception. Before they can confront her about her intentions in showing them this scene, Lamia's aunt appears, having tracked her there through the social media posts of her admirers. She angrily demands an apology from Lamia, but quickly shifts her tune to demanding compensation instead. Her greed in this confrontation exposes Lamia's true colors, and she coldly refuses to acknowledge any wrongdoing or regret in what happened after she was abused by these relatives who took her in. The Chief is forced to Shackle her to prevent her from attacking the woman.\n\nTwo days later, back in confinement at the MBCC, Lamia says that she has no need to keep acting now that the Chief has seen how she really feels. She explains that her childhood was really more humiliating than traumatic, and decided to show the Chief what happened to her cousin because she figured that they would find out eventually anyway. This way, she could make a \"preemptive strike\" and attempt to control the narrative to earn their trust and sympathy. She also confesses to having planned the President's death since the day she joined the Thaumas Society, with the ambition of leading the extortionist cult herself. She says that her whole life she's been viewed as a disgusting freak or an otherworldly idol, but never as a human being; thus, since she can't join 'em, her only approach to interacting with other people is to beat 'em. She has nothing but disdain for humans, and is perfectly content not being considered one of them. The Chief attempts to refute her assessment of humanity, so Lamia offers to show them something that will prove her point about human weakness.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>With the sudden appearance of a relative, Lamia's disguise is completely torn apart. Her true face and the real inner world are finally fully revealed in front of you.</i></p>","interrogation3":"Lamia brings the Chief to an ordinary apartment building in Eastside, where the neighbors are gossiping about a family who went insane after joining the Thaumas Society and complaining about the smells and leaks now coming from their apartment. They run away from Lamia as she approaches, recognizing her as the Ocean Messenger responsible for the change. Unbothered, Lamia leads the Chief to that apartment, which has its windows covered and is filled with rotting garbage and debris. A disheveled woman appears, but doesn't seem to notice them; Lamia says that she can only see her family. They follow her into the bedroom, where she happily offers her husband a cup of tea and a lemon tart, but her dishes are only carrying foul-smelling water and a scrap of rotten, worm-infested food. He accepts, and another cheerful voice reveals the presence of an emaciated, shrunken girl on the verge of death. Lamia explains that the girl was diagnosed with an incurable disease, and that rather than face their daughter's death, the family asked the Thaumas Society for help. At their request, Lamia has placed them all in a shared hallucination where they believe themselves to be living a happy, carefree life.\n\nThe Chief tells Lamia that this is not helping them, but she simply encourages them to say that to the family themself. Lamia brings them both into the hallucination, where the family is overjoyed to see the Ocean Messenger who gave them their happy life. Lamia informs them that it will be ending soon, because the Chief thinks they shouldn't have it, and the parents argue with them and plead to be allowed to stay in their delusion. Lamia is confident in her victory, but the Chief says that they should ask the daughter as well, since it's her own life that hangs in the balance. To Lamia's shock, the little girl agrees to return to reality, despite the inevitability of her impending death. Defeated, Lamia ends their hallucination and returns to the MBCC.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Although darkness is an inevitable part of the vast world and complex human nature, you still hope that Lamia understands that, even if accustomed to the cold and loneliness of the deep sea, one can still embrace the sunshine.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"After the Insatiable Fiesta incident, Chief took the subject back to MBCC for detention on the grounds of control and investigation. The subject was very cooperative and did not resist throughout.","arrestRec2":"The subject was born in Eastside. Her body mutation was caused by her mother's exposure to pollutants during pregnancy. Her mother died early and she was later adopted by distant relatives. During her adoption, she was mistreated for a long time and did not receive a formal school education. The subject awakened her special power when she faced a life-threatening situation from her cousin, trapping him in an illusion and causing his permanent mental disorder.","arrestRec3":"After escaping from her relative's home, the subject voluntarily contacted and joined the Thaumas Society as the \"Ocean Messenger\", using her special power to cause hallucinations in members and defraud them of money in cooperation with the society's president.

She seems to take this very seriously, not only dressed formally but also carrying a pipe.\n\n* **Prompt:** Pausing\n\n**Chief:** It doesn't seem to be smoking, so she probably isn't... But smoking is prohibited in the Bureau, carrying it around could still be a bad influence, should I remind her...\n\n**Lady Pearl:** Dear, why are you standing here? Are you here for the little adjutant? You're working hard. You should take a break.\n\n**System Notifications:** She twirls the long stem in her hand, using the end that usually touches her lips to tap your chin lightly.\n\n**Lady Pearl:** If you want to let everything go and empty yourself, you know who to go to, my dear.\n\n**Chief:** Thank you for your kindness... But, you wouldn't recommend this \"relaxing activity\" to other Sinners, would you?\n\n**Lady Pearl:** \"This\"? Ah, you mean this. If you're interested in it, just say so. I can let you experience its charm firsthand.\n\n* **Prompt:** Decline hastily\n * **Chief:** No, no, I don't have any experience, it would be bad if I choked.\n * **Lady Pearl:** Hehe, don't be so nervous. Even a lifelong smoker doesn't have experience controlling it. After all, it's just a stage prop.\n * **Chief:** Stage prop? You mean, you don't actually smoke?\n * **Lady Pearl:** Oh dear, you've seen through me!\n * **Chief:** But if you don't smoke, why do you carry it around...\n * **Lady Pearl:** It's part of my \"character image.\" In the world of fame and fortune, if you want to navigate with ease, without anyone catching your weakness, you have to be able to smoke, drink, be cultured, martial, arrogant and humble.\n * **Lady Pearl:** \"Lady Pearl the Socialite\" of course knows best, this is also a stereotype. In order to maintain such an image, it's an indispensable helper for me when socializing.\n * **Chief:** So you brought it with you today just because you see the negotiation with Nightingale as a serious social event to be taken seriously...\n * **Lady Pearl:** Dear, you understand me best! If you also want to \"put on a show\" next time, I can help you make a similar prop. A symbol can be very useful in building an image.\n\n* **Prompt:** Accept calmly\n * **Chief:** I could, but I don't have a lighter.\n * **Lady Pearl:** Hehe, you don't need fire to make it smoke.\n * **System Notifications:** Before you can react, Lady Pearl gently taps a spot on the pipe, and soon smoke rises from the other end.\n * **Chief:** Huh? There's clearly no tobacco inside... Where did this smoke come from?\n * **Lady Pearl:** This is the same principle as those smoke-emitting stage props, just miniaturized. Or rather, my dear, what you see is just a stage prop.\n * **Chief:** So... you don't actually smoke? This is just for show?\n * **Lady Pearl:** Bingo! Since \"Lady Pearl the Socialite\" always has to deal with those who revel in unhealthy habits, I need to know how to take a puff.\n * **Lady Pearl:** Maintaining a stereotype different from your true self can be difficult, but it can also be simple. If you ever need it, dear, you can come to me anytime."}

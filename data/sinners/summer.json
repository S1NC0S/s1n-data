Once praised as an extremely rare genius, the subject was the Ring Research Institute's youngest member. The subject was exposed for owning the core technology of a classified forbidden weapon without permission. She refused the institute's collaboration request and betrayed the institute.\n\nThe subject's behaviors directly led to the leak of Ring Weapon technology into the market and facilitated the creation of Mania Weapons, greatly worsening the violence in Syndicate.\n\n--\n\nIt's now been proven that the Research Institute violated the regulations early on and sold Ring Weapon-related technology to Parma. The contamination-loaded Mania weapons available in the market are products of Parma's evil research.\n\nIt's confirmed that the subject has invented a contamination-free Ring Weapon. Her invention has improved the lives of many and she provides essential support behind various major missions of the Bureau.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThe subject has lower-than-average physical health statistics but her intelligence far exceeds the mean, the upper limit of her IQ indeterminable by any currently available tests.

The scientist they speak to over the phone doesn't have the answers, instead pointing them to Summer, and provides them with an item they can use to pique her interest. Some time later, the Chief meets a disinterested Summer in the interrogation room, who dodges the question after the Chief shows her a Mania weapon. The Chief then produces the item: a heavily encrypted data drive that no one in the MBCC could crack. Summer lights up, promising to answer any question in exchange for it, and the Chief agrees. Summer cracks the code in seconds. The drive contains a video, a storyboard for the first episode of an animated series titled //The Age of Youth//. It is based loosely on her life, beginning with when a young, sickly Summer saw an anime that first motivated her to become a hero, launching her on her impressive early tear through academia.\n\nThe Chief asks once more about Mania Crystals and the nature of the \"Ring substance\" that they are made of. Summer likens the situation in the crypt to a glass of water: much like a lower temperature would cause more ice to form in the glass, a higher contamination rate would cause more Ring substance to form inside the crypt. A Mania Crystal, she explains, is what happens when Ring substance absorbs a Sinner's [[[spiritual energy]]]. Unlike regular contamination from Manic humans, the Ring substance seems to draw its power from elsewhere, though she has yet to find out where. She knows that [[[PARMA]]] has some means to force Sinners to maintain a Manic state in order to lengthen the time in which the Ring substance can form Mania Crystals, citing Ninety-Nine as a victim of such experiments. On the topic of PARMA, the Chief produces a distress signal that came from one of their labs, supposedly related to Mania weapons. When they question Summer on whether she knows about the incident, she arbitrarily decides to end their so-called \"Q&A session,\" instead rushing off to watch more anime.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Mania Crystals, the Ring substance.... These mysterious and deadly substances seem to be mere playthings in Summer's hands. No one expected this mad genius to have such a deep secret. The videotape has resolved the question that no one could answer. At least for now, you want your relationship to be one of mentor and friend instead of Sinner and warden.</i></p>","interrogation2":"Some time after the Chief absorbs the Inheritance, they begin to experience a recurring nightmare in which they are devoured by a Corpseborne, demanding that they \"accept the Gift.\" Despite the unsettling nature of it, the Chief describes the feeling of the corruption as natural and familiar. Upon waking up, they once again contact the Ring Research Institute, and before they can even explain, the scientist sends them to Summer once again, providing them with another encrypted drive. Not having shared the details of what happened with anyone outside the Bureau, the Chief suspects that the Institute may be spying on them. The next episode of //The Age of Youth// details Summer's progress on the Ring weapon after being expelled from the Institute. This time, having spent the last few months building up a rapport, Summer comments that the Chief is less anxious when they spend time together. She asks what difficult questions have been on their mind lately, and the Chief asks about the nature of Black Rings. As Summer begins to muse on the topic, the Chief recalls the feeling of absorbing the corruption at Keylan Square, almost vomiting in the process.\r\n\r\nSummer describes how being stuck inside a Black Ring can lead one to becoming subsumed by the will of its host. She explains that the Ring substance is a byproduct of this will invading reality, saying that it contains \"extremely strong mental power\", hence why she chose it to power her Ring Weapon. The Chief asks how to stop spiritual contamination, and Summer replies that the only way to do so is to eliminate the source of Mania entirely: Black Rings. She states that the Inheritances are the sole cause of Black Rings, and that should she be able to get her hands on one, she would finally be able to learn \"the truth of the world.\" The Chief tries to describe the Inheritance without revealing that they have absorbed it, but Summer, having already infiltrated the Bureau's intranet, has already figured out the truth. She becomes increasingly frantic and excited at the possibility of the discoveries she could make, turning her weapons on the Chief. When the Chief tries to call for help, they find that Summer has already disabled the security systems. Chiding that they have underestimated the power of //Infinite Knowledge//, Summer hits them with a tranquilizer shot, quickly knocking them unconscious.\r\n\r\nThe Ring Research Institute scientist, whose name is revealed to be Laplace, receives word that the Chief and Summer have gone missing. Having already anticipated this outcome, he suspects that they have gone to the ruins of the PARMA Laboratory.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Summer's senses are just too sharp. She catches on that something's wrong from just a few words. Her curiosity has been ignited after learning that you've absorbed the Inheritance. After bringing you under control, this mad scientist is now free of all restraints.</i></p>","interrogation3":"The Chief awakens in a glass containment tank, finding that Summer has somehow disabled the Shackles. She calls the Chief \"the ideal candidate for the Inheritance,\" confident that they won't mutate into a monster. She explains that PARMA Laboratory was where the Inheritance was originally stored, making it the perfect testing ground for her own experiments on it. She fills the tank with a blue solution she calls \"Inheritance Catalyst Number Three,\" which plunges the Chief back into the corrupting sensations of their earlier nightmare while somehow mitigating their anxiety.  They deduce that Summer wants to replicate the Inheritance's original form, but soon, the holding tank begins to collapse. As the Chief attempts to persuade the panicking Summer about the dangerous nature of the Inheritance, Laplace emerges from the shadows. He makes Summer an offer: return to the Research Institute and he'll not only protect her from the MBCC, but give her all the funding and facilities she needs to finish her current project.\r\n\r\nSummer calls Laplace boring. He says that the \"tragedy of PARMA\" won't happen again, attempting to entice her with the promise of making her a hero, but she refuses. She reveals that the Institute sold her research to PARMA and that she has no intention of trusting them ever again. After warning the Chief that a battle is about to begin, dozens of armed men open fire on her. Laplace taunts her, but Summer quickly turns the tides of battle, reducing all of his backup to ash. Laplace dons a strange glove that glows with a blue light, its aura reminding Chief of their battle with the Corpseborne. The Chief reaches inside their mind, digging for the \"truth\" that Summer has been searching for, and manages to harness the power of the Inheritance with the help of the state induced by the solution. Extending the Shackles through the tank, they empower Summer to be able to withstand Laplace's attack. The two scientists fire their weapons at the same time, filling the room with a blinding white light.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The Ring Research Institute anticipated all of Summer's actions. Even the research conducted on you is part of their plan. Laplace, or rather the Ring Research Institute, anticipated everything. They want to use you to lure Summer back to the Ring Research Institute. However, it seems that this genius doesn't have the best relationship with the institute. The blazing light that pierced the sky once again shines over the Laboratory of Parma.</i></p>","interrogation4":"The Chief awakens in an unknown infirmary with Summer standing over them. She informs them that while their body is in good shape, the Inheritance is still inside of them, and based on her research, she can't guarantee their safety if they either overuse the Shackles of get too close to another Black Ring. She warns the Chief that danger may accompany further learning on the subject, and in turn, the Chief warns her that the longer they spend away from the Bureau, the more likely that Summer's punishment will be more severe than a trip to the confinement cell. Summer says that they can do so after they finish //Age of Youth//. She takies the Chief downstairs, changes into a school uniform, and says that today, they'll be filming it in person.She has brought the Chief to a high school on graduation day, intending to finally gain the experience of graduating for herself.\r\n\r\nAs the ceremony begins, Summer reflects on the loneliness she felt in school. In her mind, //Age of Youth// has to end with Summer's return to normal life with her friends, but without any friends to speak of, Summer says that she'll make due the Chief. Once the last diploma is handed out, the Chief asks Summer if she wants to mingle with the students. She hesitates, and Nightingale finally gets through, promising that a rescue team will arrive shortly. The Chief apologizes, but Summer is understanding. In the car on the way back to the Bureau, Summer says that future battles will only be tougher, but that with the Chief as her companion, she will surely find a way to save the world.\r\n\r\nLater, in the confinement cell, Summer complains that without chocolate, she won't be able to finish animating //Age of Youth.// Although the Chief threatens to lower her supply, they decide to raise it instead, hoping that this small act of kindness can begin to compensate Summer for once again missing the graduation of her dreams.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The last episode of The Age of Youth is finally released in a high school of Eastside. No special effect or expensive props. It just feels like some ordinary life moment, but it becomes a regret of Summer's that can never be compensated.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"Following an order from the top, the MBCC spent a long time tracking and observing the subject and finally arrested her when she attended her graduation ceremony while still injured.

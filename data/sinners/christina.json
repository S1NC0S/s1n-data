She applied four times but was rejected each time, and was finally admitted with her uncle's recommendation.\nShe has an almost obsessive desire for \"justice\" and her mental state is unstable. She frequently resorts to violence to solve cases. Her behavior is quite unpredictable. Detainment is advised.\n\n--\n\nNaturally cheerful and optimistic, the subject's unstable mental condition stems from two major incidents: her parents' deaths and the discovery of Shalom's true identity. After being detained by the MBCC, she demonstrated good and helpful behavior without any violations, earning unanimous praise from the Bureau. Under the guidance and company of Chief, she still firmly believes in and pursues justice, but her stubbornness has softened, and she rarely experiences emotional breakdowns or loss of control.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nWhen she knows she's carrying out \"justice\", her combat power increases proportionally to the degree of justice. Moreover, she must firmly believe in her own sense of justice, otherwise she will suffer a backlash from her power and fall into depression. Her preferred weapons include a special Detective File reinforced with metal, and a special cane embedded with a small amount of Hypercubes and rare metals. These weapons are highly destructive when used alongside her power.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nThe subject's emotions became extremely unstable after learning of her parents' death. She obsessively compiled relevant evidence and events to uncover the truth and avenge them. After discovering part of what she believed to be the truth, she lost control of her emotions and her power awakened.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nHer degree of corruption is mild, and there is no visible lesions on her body. Though she usually appears lively and cheerful, her mental state is unstable. She breaks down and succumbs to self-blame when she cannot achieve justice or is not needed by others.","ecbFlavourText":"\"The power of justice and truth!\"","interrogation1":"Now under the Bureau's supervision, the Chief has been occupying Christina with petty cases to prevent her from dwelling on the events of Flora Unfurl. While reading a headline about a high-profile antique robbery, they receive a message from her requesting an urgent meeting. In the interrogation room, Christina presents them some information regarding a recent theft at a cat cafe, in which a young man identified as Henry broke and stole three cats. The conversation takes a brief turn towards Shalom, but once the Chief gets Christina back on topic, she expresses a great interest in being allowed to go out and solve this case herself. In an effort to raise her spirits, the Chief agrees, but only on the condition that the two of them go together. Christina accepts, happy to formally take the Chief on as her assistant.\r\n\r\n//Your \"stalling tactic\" worked. Christina indeed got distracted by the \"Eastside cat cafe theft case\" and temporarily put Shalom to the back of her mind. You will help her investigate the case as her \"assistant,\" and search for the cat thief and the missing cat.//","interrogation2":"An investigation of those familiar with Henry, including the barista at the cat cafe, paint a picture of a sympathetic young man, though still not one that explains why he would steal the cats. Learning that he hasn't been seen for several days, Christina and the Chief go to the Public Security Bureau, where Christina attempts to argue for Henry's innocence. Her request for a more formal investigation is denied, with the reason given being that available resources should go towards cases with more tangible evidence, such as the antique theft incident, as opposed to those involving run-of-the-mill street thugs. Despite Christina's appeals to justice and equality in the eyes of the law, she and the Chief are left once more to take matters into their own hands.\r\n\r\nA cursory search of Henry's apartment reveals that he's been spending a large portion of his welfare money on cat food for strays. They also discover his large collection of mystery novels. The two bring the food to his home-made cat shelter, finding not only the three missing cats, but a mysterious piece of graffiti. Christina then realizes that this is a trail left for them to follow. Once the two piece the clues together to form a specific address, they set out immediately.\r\n\r\n//After a series of investigations, you discover that the real Henry is quite different from what you initially thought. There is more to this seemingly simple case of cat theft. You found the cats, but Henry is still missing. At the same time, you piece together the message he left you through the cat names: 4 Inkborough Street.//","interrogation3":"The pair find Henry tied up in a warehouse, surrounded by a businessman and a group of mercenaries. The mercenaries reveal that the antique theft case was actually a hoax set up to allow the businessman to profit from insurance fraud. Christina and the Chief leap into action, freeing Henry and subduing almost all of the suspects. The sole escapee is stopped by Henry and a squadron of police officers, called to the scene by a terminal that Henry received from the Chief. Despite his role in solving the case, Henry is still arrested for breaking and entering, an act that Christina decries. Henry reassures her that his sacrifice was worth it -- he finally got to play the detective role of his dreams, an accomplishment well worth a short jail sentence.\r\n\r\nLater, Christina tells the Chief that she managed to use her connections not only to get Henry released, but to get him employed in the Public Security Bureau's  undercover program. She thanks the Chief for their help and asks them if they would be willing to serve as her assistant on her continued mission of uncovering the truth about Shalom. The Chief readily agrees, hoping to give her the closure she deserves.\r\n\r\n//This complex, gray world needs idealists like Christina. She might seem a bit naive to others, but she resolutely believes in justice... The great detective and her little assistant will keep marching down the path of justice without waivering.//","arrestRec1":"The subject voluntarily came to the MBCC's doorstep and revealed her identity as a Sinner to Chief. She let the Bureau detain her and actively cooperated with the investigation.","arrestRec2":"The subject hails from a military family in Eastside. Both her parents served in the FAC and were killed on duty in N.F. 103. She was later adopted by her aunt's family, who also worked for the FAC. However, her inner turmoil never settled, leading her to obsessively compile relevant evidence and events to uncover the truth behind her parents' deaths and avenge them.","arrestRec3":"The subject has known her younger cousin Mireya since childhood, but they often clashed and didn't have a smooth relationship. It wasn't until the Garden assassination case in N.F. 112 when her uncle was killed, that Mireya truly understood and acknowledged her. Their relationship greatly improved afterwards.","arrestRec4":"At the lowest point in her life, the subject learned how to use her power. With the help and encouragement of HUSH (Shalom), she embarked on a path of seeking justice. However, she was then traumatized by discovering Shalom's true identity, and became determined to prove her sense of justice to her.","servingTerm1":"The luggage she brought with her when she joined the MBCC included a large collection of detective novels, which she continues to add to. The subject is intimately familiar with crime fiction, and has offered many valuable suggestions for mystery-themed films for the Recreation Area's movie nights.","servingTerm2":"The subject maintains a positive attitude towards life, taking her daily training and dispatch assignments seriously and always striving to complete them to the best of her ability. Although she often causes equipment wear and tear due to poor control of her strength, she still sets a good example for the other Sinners","servingTerm3":"The subject is outgoing and can strike up a pleasant conversation with anyone. She's well-liked within the Bureau, and her positive influence has impacted many Sinners who were originally introverted and melancholic. Additionally, she's known for being always ready to help, and is enthusiastic in helping both Sinners and Bureau staff with life and work problems without expecting anything in return.","servingTerm4":"Despite being at the MBCC, the subject has never slackened in her duties and work as the Acting Inspector. She voluntarily uses her downtime to read and organize case files sent by the Public Security Bureau, dragging along Chief, whom she refers to as her \"assistant\", to work on cases outside.","emotionCheck1":"[Christina is practicing her freestyle fighting skills by pummeling the punching bag in the Training Room.]\n\n**Christina:** Ah, my dear assistant.

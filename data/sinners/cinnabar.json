Later, in the interrogation room (and after some teasing about her being an androgynous heart-throb), the Chief inquires about the reason that Cinnabar was fired. She explains that while being tasked with protecting a delegation, she caught sight of and subsequently stopped a gang from raiding a civilian block. Despite saving many lives in the process, she was branded as a criminal for deserting her squadmates and going against orders. She harbors intense guilt about letting Serpent Eye down in a critical moment, feeling that she has irreversibly broken their trust.\n\nThe Chief informs her about Alyosha's call and the reasons behind his application for requisition. At the mention of his name, she lights up, asking further questions about the details of the mission. The Chief explains and Cinnabar immediately comes up with the optimal countermeasures, but her mood darkens once again after her excitement subsides. The Chief reassures her that despite her actions, Serpent Eye still has their contract with Eastside and the city council. They also insist that Cinnabar's colleagues don't hold any grudges against her, citing that Alyosha himself vouched for her capabilities. This gives her the boost of confidence she needs to accept the mission -- even knowing that the Chief has to accompany her.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The interrogation went surprisingly well. Finally, you have a rough idea of Cinnabar's past. The security operation is taking place next week. Both you and Cinnabar must get ready.</i></p>","interrogation2":"Shortly after the Chief rescues Cinnabar from being hit on by yet another woman, Alyosha meets the two of them in person. The atmosphere is tense as they go over their status, and Alyosha informs Cinnabar that Reagan's five VIPs aren't going to be subjected to a security check. After Reagan gives his speech, he invites the VIPs on stage to award them for assisting in his Home Reconstruction Project, an effort designed to create housing for displaced Syndicans. Despite being from Syndicate herself, Cinnabar doesn't recognize any of them, nor does she recall hearing of such a project; in fact, she remembers a much different story: a high death toll in the collapse of a poorly-constructed housing development. Putting the pieces together, she springs into action, but one of the VIPs handcuffs himself to Reagan before she can reach him. The man announces nervously that he has a bomb strapped to his chest, and chaos ensues in the venue.\n\nVia a speaker on the man's neck, the perpetrator demands that Reagan compensate the victims of the aforementioned disaster. Reagan remains calm, and after Cinnabar radios Serpent Eye to deploy their EMP, she subdues the would-be attacker, a teenage boy nearby equipped with a tablet and detonator. When the lights come back on, Alyosha removes the handcuffs on Reagan's wrist. Reagan then calmly takes Alyosha's gun from its holster and shoots his VIP dead.\n\nReagan coldly rebukes Alyosha's performance before turning to leave. On his way out, he calls Cinnabar \"a filthy street rat\", and the attacker screams at him, promising vengeance for what he did to Syndicate. Alyosha moves to kill the attacker, saying that it's part of the client's orders, but Cinnabar protects the boy instead. The Chief and Cinnabar stand up for each other in the face of Alyosha's growing rage, and though Alyosha eventually relents, he does so only after reopening Cinnabar's wounded pride. The Chief makes a final attempt to mend their strained connection, and although Alyosha stops to consider it, he and the rest of Serpent Eye leave without saying a word. With the room now empty except for the two of them, Cinnabar breaks down crying, and the two embrace.\n\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>No one expected that this would end up like this. Though only a few were injured on site and the attacker was captured, it is still a troubling issue how Cinnabar went on their separate ways. Perhaps you should do something about it.</i></p>","interrogation3":"Two months later, Cinnabar and the Chief discuss the difficulty of getting a search warrant for Reagan. Cinnabar fears for Serpent Eye's safety, but it isn't until a few days later that Alyosha finally returns their calls. He informs them that Serpent Eye no longer works for the City Council, but that it wasn't Cinnabar's fault. He offers to meet her. The Chief accompanies her to a bar on the border between Eastside and Syndicate, where she explains that her father and Alyosha helped found Serpent Eye thirty years prior. Despite the uneasy way they last parted, Serpent Eye welcomes her with open arms, extending their kindness to the Chief as well. They fondly discuss the past, and Cinnabar says regardless of the paths she's taken in life, Serpent Eye will always be her home.\n\nAlyosha, who'd been drinking silently in the corner until now, drunkenly interrupts, decrying the MBCC and criticizing Cinnabar for choosing to be a prisoner instead of rejoining them. Cinnabar stands up for herself and her choices, promising him that she could never forget the values and lessons that he and everyone in Serpent Eye have taught her, including instilling her with desire to protect others. Alyosha asks her if she considers the Chief, who he views as her captor and slavedriver, to be someone worth protecting. She does, saying that not only is the Chief important to her, but that it's been her choice to stay in the MBCC. Stunned into silence, Alyosha returns to his corner, and as the other Serpent Eye members encourage him to let it go, he passes out finishing his vodka. After insinuating that the Chief and Cinnabar are somehow involved, the veterans attempt to get the Chief drunk. Cinnabar intervenes, proposing a toast instead. This snowballs into a drinking contest that Cinnabar wins with ease.\n\nAs she attempts to leave with the Chief, Alyosha stops them at the door, giving the Chief a firm pat on the shoulder. Seeing him finally accept them, the rest of Serpent Eye cheer, and Cinnabar smiles at her now-growing found family.\n\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Right before you part ways, you and the people of Serpent Eye exchanged your business cards. They promised to keep in touch with you and Cinnabar. You saw a happy smile on Cinnabar's face. And that is all that matters.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"During the period the subject was wanted, she used an alias and hid in Syndicate, working as a mercenary.

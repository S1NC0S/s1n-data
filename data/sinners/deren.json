But she has since stopped making movies, for reasons unknown.\n\nIn the Blockbuster Films Incident, the unleashing of her power wrecked public property and caused a large-scale stampede. She should be detained as soon as possible.\n\n--\n\nThe subject's works still contain residual Mania effect. With her permission, they have all been removed to eradicate possible contamination.\n\nHaving spent time with Chief during the Blockbuster Films Incident and in the Bureau, the subject gradually begins to trust Chief and becomes more willing to open up.\n\nChief's talks with the subject have been effective. Though her mindset is yet to be entirely shaken, she's not as pessimistic and indifferent as before.",

She can turn the script or whatever she's holding into a sharp, heavy weapon by thinking about it, and she can also acquire a close approximation of the abilities of a powerful superhero by picturing herself being that superhero.\n\n+++* Awakening Signs\nAccording to available data, Deren's M-value might have reached the power-awakening threshold after she was exposed to an unidentified source of Mania some time ago. She then became an S-class Sinner after experiencing mood swings while making movies. It's suspected that her movies can subject viewers to a certain level of Maniac contamination, so as a precaution, the MBCC, upon getting Deren's agreement, pulled all her movies out of circulation.\n\n+++* Corruption State\nDeren awakened her power relatively early, and suffers only from a low level of Maniac corruption, with no abnormalities found on her body. Most of the time, she's mentally stable, but her mental state is liable to become unstable when she is making movies.",

  "interrogation1": "After the disastrous end of the DisCars, the Chief returns to Dollywood to investigate whether any of the Apostle's power remains. They quickly run into Deren, who is fleeing from a group of producers and reporters eager to rope her back into the film industry. She and the Chief escape together, and the Chief brings her back to the isolated safety of the [[[minos bureau of crisis control |MBCC]]]. There, Deren readily agrees to be detained. She doesn't seem bothered by incarceration or the need to follow the Chief's orders, only interested in free food and accommodation and the ability to avoid the industry that wants her back.\n\nConfused about her motivations, the Chief asks Deren about why she quit being a director, famously not attending the DisCars five years prior when her film //Guest List for the Ball// won the highest honors. Deren replies that the version of the movie submitted for consideration was not the directors cut; it had been edited in such a way as to completely change the message that she was trying to convey. Because of that, she saw the event as something for the judges and audience, and nothing to do with her. Despite her feelings on the subject, though, Deren claims that she does not remember what her intent for the film had actually been. the Chief can't believe this, and decides to investigate independently.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>During the interrogation, you learn that Deren's awarded film from five years ago is called //Guest List for the Ball//, but she refuses to talk about its content.\nYou want to learn more about Deren, so you decide to continue investigating on your own.</i></p>",
  "interrogation2": "While pondering how to learn more about Deren, the Chief comes across [[[Luvia Ray]]] and realizes that she is in the film industry, and thus might have some insight. Luvia is a big fan of Deren, and produces a flash drive that contains the now-banned theatrical release of //Guest List for the Ball//. The film is avant-garde and conceptual, shot from first-person perspective and depicting the viewer's encounters with a variety of attendees at a party. Each attendee is scared and struggling with some sort of abstract ailment and they are each called, one by one, to dance in the center of the ball by a chorus of ominous voices that promise to bring them happiness. The first is a girl in a white dress is looking for someone to love her, who dances with a man whose face is in shadow and becomes increasingly beaten down. A pale-faced boy wants his siblings to be taken care of before he dies, and thorny vines grow through his body, tearing apart as his dance goes on. The final attendee is a woman in a suit, who tries to help the protagonist escape from the ball, but is dragged back by the other guests. As she dances, her suit transforms into a gown. Despite their ailments during the dances, however, the final shot of the film shows them all lying together in a field of flowers, apparently having been granted the happiness they desired.\n\nLuvia and the Chief discuss the movie, and agree that it deserves the many DisCars that it won. Deren reveals that she has been listening to their conversation, and is bemused by their praise until the Chief points out that it feels like something is unresolved, and asks if there will be a sequel. Deren abruptly storms off, leaving behind her notebook with ideas for the film.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>After watching the non-director's cut version of the film, Deren shows up. She asks you what impression of her the movie left you.\nShe seems indifferent to your answer. By the time you decide to continue investigating, she's already walked off, but a notebook about Guest List for the Ball is left there. </i></p>",
  "interrogation3": "[[[Nightingale]]] reports that an Eastside councilor has taken Deren away for a temporary release. She hands the Chief a livestream of an interview Deren is giving in Dillywood, where she half-heartedly answers questions in an evasive and unhelpful way. The crowd of reporters is unfazed, and continues to pressure her further. Through the Shackles, the Chief instructs her to run away, and they meet her escaping through the back alleys. The Chief takes her a factory in the city, and reveals that they had found and read her notebook on //Guest List for the Ball//. They discuss how the final film ended up being heavily edited; Deren had envisioned a story about people who accepted their fate, and then found that it came at the cost of their destruction. However, it was made it into a story about people's dreams coming true. Nevertheless, Deren accepts what happened. She recognizes that a lot more people than just her were invested in the movie's success, and that her vision would not have been as widely accepted and would have wasted the efforts of everybody else who worked on it. So, just like the characters in her director's cut, she stopped making movies and accepted reality.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>You help Deren flee the reporters' cameras and questions, and the veil of mystery about that movie is finally lifted.\nDeren feels bored about \"having no choice but to accept reality\". That was the main reason she stopped making movies.</i></p>",
  "interrogation4": "The Chief and Deren continue their conversation. The Chief reveals that the factory they are at was owned by the woman whom Deren based her movie on. Deren had found the woman's journal at a junk shop, and read about how she had a shrewd mind for business but was forced into marriage by her family. She became the inspiration for the third character in //Guest List for the Ball//, while the first two dancers were both inspired by employees of hers at the factory. The Chief continues to explain that the factory is now owned by that woman's brother, and that after seeing Deren's film, he was inspired to honor her dream and name the business after her. The two of them both agree that the movie should have ended the way Deren envisioned it, but that it could still inspire beauty in its final cut.\n\nDeren attends the delayed DisCars ceremony, having announced that she would debut a new film there after all. She instead screens her director's cut of //Guest List for the Ball//, which initially confuses the audience as they believe it to be the same movie as five years before, but then begins to disturb them as they see how different this version of the story is. Deren exults in their discomfort as she finally walks the red carpet out of the awards, after having refused to do so when //Guest List for the Ball// first premiered.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Accepting reality doesn't mean giving in to fate. In life, most people dream until they can't anymore. But there are always those who'd rather dance barefoot on fragments and catch the last glimmer of their dreams. These people are inevitably deemed as //lunatics// by others, but... that's not a big deal, is it?</i></p>",

  "arrestRec2": "A well-known director whose work won many DisCars, Deren was regarded in the film industry as a rare talent. She was well-versed in many aspects of filmmaking, such as writing, camerawork, soundtrack, and editing. She is also observant; she is attuned to people's feelings but knows when to step back to better dissect those feelings. She masterfully wove together the characters, the story and the mood into a breathtaking work of art.",
  "arrestRec3": "The movie Deren had intended to submit for DisCars consideration was dark yet romantic. Based on what she had observed, the movie brought to light the struggle and outcry of those trapped in the darkness. But under pressure from the film distributor and investor to improve their chances of winning, Deren agreed to have the movie re-edited by someone else. The re-edited version won many DisCars, but it failed to convey the message in the director's cut.",
  "arrestRec4": "Deren didn't attend the DisCars ceremony that year, nor did she give any interviews. She received many compliments for the movie, but the compliments were nothing more than a flattering label. She left Eastside and gave up her directing career.

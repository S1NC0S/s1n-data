This effect can be triggered up to once every 5 seconds.","maniaIntensifyTitle":"Professionalism","maniaIntensifyText":"Defense increases by 10%.","criminalRecord":"Nino Sama, a virtual streamer who's made a name for herself in Eastside, quickly attracted a large fanbase with her superb gaming skills and witty commentary. She used her abilities to project her live streams to various locations in DisCity several times, causing a significant disruption to public order.\n\n--\n\nAfter receiving training, she has not exhibited any manic tendencies, and her level of corruption has significantly decreased. Meanwhile, her social circle in the real world has greatly expanded. Although she continues to livestream, her verbal aggression during the streams has been somewhat mitigated. There have been no instances of \"stream hijacking\" during her broadcasts. To ensure her combat effectiveness, MBCC staff and Sinners regularly monitor her live stream.\n","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nHer power strength is directly proportional to the number of viewers and the intensity of their emotional feelings. The more viewers and the more intense their emotional feelings, the stronger and wider the range of her power. Similarly, her combat abilities are also enhanced to a certain degree.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nBased on her corruption and the objective time during which she became a popular streamer, it is inferred that she experienced a strong emotional shock two years ago, which triggered her awakening.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nShe has a moderate degree of corruption. Studies suggest that this is due to the long-term use of her abilities. If she continues to use her abilities for an extended period, there is a risk of further spread of Mania.","ecbFlavourText":"\"I'm not afraid of...you!!!\"\n\"You're no different than the monsters in the game!!!\"","interrogation1":"[[[Chief |The Chief]]] takes advantage of a rare slow day to check in with some of their subordinates. In the middle of a discussion about Nino's next livestream, all of the Bureau's screens are hacked, now broadcasting Nino herself, who instead of using a virtual avatar, is appearing with live video footage. Along with announcing the end of her brief hiatus, she openly declares her identity as a Sinner. This prompts the Chief into action. Swiftly arriving at Nino's home, they draw her outside by posing as a food delivery person. Strangely, she appears to be somewhat resistant to the [[[Shackles.]]] Despite this, they successfully Shackle her, quickly subduing her with the help of the Arrest Team. \n\nNino is brought back to the MBCC for questioning. There, the Chief notices that she has a persistent cough. She expresses a strong desire to be loved by the masses, confident that the Chief will also fall under her spell after watching her most viewed video: footage of her fighting Corruptors with her pixel sword and shield. Although she becomes more cooperative after the Chief agrees to allow her to livestream from within the Bureau (albeit under certain conditions), she still refuses to answer why she streams with a virtual avatar, especially one that looks exactly like her.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>You and the city arrest team raided Sinner Nino's residence and successfully detained her. You agreed to Nino's live stream conditions, with the aim of studying and observing her slightly special ability more closely.</i></p>","interrogation2":"Nino's stream goes as planned. Analysis from its runtime shows that her M-Value is abnormally high, and after she exits the room, she once again shows signs of strain. The researchers report that Nino's ability has a complex structure; its usage creates a large amount of uncontrollable Mania, which has been accumulating since her awakening and resulted in both her declining health and heightened M-Value. This only occurs when her viewers' emotions become heightened, resulting in a kind of [[[resonance.]]] The Chief gently refuses when Nino asks for more stream time. Growing despondent, she quietly returns to her room, mumbling about how she'll just have to game alone like she used to.\n\nThe Chief decides to check in with Nino's neighbor, an older woman who she once referenced on stream. The woman explains that Nino's parents moved to [[[Nirvana]]] to provide for her, but as a result, left her alone with her grandmother, who passed away some years ago. Nino used to be a shy and lonely child, but that changed when she returned from a trip to the outskirts of Eastside, the viral moment of her awakening that was caught on film. Upon returning to the Bureau, [[[Nightingale]]] reports that the Bureau's M-Value has surpassed a critical threshold, citing Nino as the cause. The Chief rushes to her aid, finding her entrapped in a dense, black sphere. As she spirals into a deep depression, the Chief attempts to free her with the Shackles.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>While Nino's livestream talent certainly surprised you, what surprised you even more was how Nino behaved in front of her neighbor. It was as if the silly, chatty host you knew changed into a completely different person.</i></p>","interrogation3":"The Chief witnesses Nino's memories: her parents' trips growing longer and longer, the depression that resulted from it, and how she found solace in online gaming. Her determination to break free from loneliness is what eventually resulted in her awakening, her power drawn from the emotions of the viewers she created by accidentally projecting the event to every device in Eastside. She felt the repercussions of the emotional resonance, but she knew that its existence was proof of her finally getting the attention she longed for, refusing to stop even though it put her at risk. Just as she feels she's on the verge of death, the Chief frees her from the swirling void.\n\nAfter her power is contained, the Chief encourages Nino to try making friends with the other Sinners, sensing that her demeanor has changed. Just when it seems the Chief can finally enjoy a day's rest, Nightingale reveals that Nino's page has a new top video: a recording of the moment of her arrest, posted by none other than the delivery person who Chief impersonated. The Chief requests that Nightingale take down the video, to which she promptly agrees.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>You successfully suppressed Nino's Mania and devised a new training plan for her. Meanwhile, due to your negligence that night, the live stream plan was leaked, and now you need to submit a 1500-word review report to Nightingale.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"She was once involved in a Mania incident with the MBCC Chief. After the incident, she escaped from the scene, but was later caught and detained by the MBCC Chief when she resumed live streaming a few days later.","arrestRec2":"She once gained a lot of fame from a stream in which she was attacked by a Corruptor. According to her own account, this was a livestream she had meticulously planned, with the aim of attracting public attention.","arrestRec3":"She has lived alone for a long time, with few interpersonal relationships. She spends the majority of her income on purchasing live-streaming equipment and materials.","arrestRec4":"During her long-term solitary life, she developed a serious dependency on the internet due to her inability to interact normally with others. This led to her strong interest in video games and online forums. To attract attention from others, she repeatedly made radical statements during her live streams. She has been warned and educated by the MBCC Chief.","servingTerm1":"She has a strong interest in puffed food, fried food, and carbonated drinks. At the time of her detention, she had a cavity. After treatment, her daily diet is now fully managed by MBCC.","servingTerm2":"She is a loyal user of a forum named DisMyth, often frequenting its gaming threads. To draw attention, she often makes provocative or trolling comments. She has had 53 of her accounts banned to date.","servingTerm3":"Her weapons, Lævateinn and Svalin, are modeled after the rare hidden sword-shield with a drop rate of less than 0.1% from a once-popular online game called Legion of Warcraft in DisCity. She is currently a hardcore player of Codename: Dark, playing it for more than two hours daily.","servingTerm4":"The MBCC Chief finally agreed to her request to livestream, on the condition that she refrains from using her abilities for extended periods and learns to control them. She is currently receiving training at the MBCC.","emotionCheck1":"[Nino is checking the live stream's traffic flow chart.]\n\n**Nino:** What's going on? The views have dropped so much recently!

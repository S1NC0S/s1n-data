Assassinated multiple important politicians, entrepreneurs, and gang leaders. Involved in over a hundred murders in which all targets were killed by one critical attack. No clues about the subject's identity and whereabouts were ever exposed and the subject posed an immense threat to the safety of big shots in different domains.\n\n--\n\nThe subject seems to have developed a strong infatuation with Chief. She obeys all orders by Chief unconditionally and is extremely stable in her detention. The subject has long quit //the Garden// and claims to have left all her illegal businesses behind.

Despite this, Sumire is very cooperative, detailing some of the Garden's history and surface-level workings for the Chief, as well as confirming that a few suspicious deaths of FAC employees were indeed carried out by the Garden. The Chief questions her about how such murders are conducted, to which Sumire replies that the Garden relies largely on the abilities of its Sinners. The Chief then asks if Sumire herself carried out these murders, which she calmly denies, implying that she only deals with commissions on a much higher level.\n\nThe Chief asks why Sumire is willing to be so cooperative, wondering if she had a falling out with the Garden. Sumire assures them that she still loves and respects everyone in the Garden, simply that her presence within the MBCC could be considered as a warning. She claims that she doesn't have to worry about giving away this level of information because she believes in the strength of \"The Mentor,\" the Garden's leader, who she feels confident could take down the FAC single-handedly. The Chief asks that Sumire reveal more of the Garden's secrets, hoping to prevent any unnecessary Sinners casualties at the hands of the FAC. Sumire comments on the Chief's frequent kindness, but apologizes, saying she is unwilling to betray the Garden's trust. The Chief tries to leverage that they won't be able to stop the FAC special commissioner from using methods like torture and truth serum, but Sumire replies that as one of the Garden's \"creations,\" she will stay silent when faced with the FAC. \"Besides,\" she says, \"he might not be able to make it here.\"\n\nNightingale informs the Chief that the Commissioner will arrive soon. Frustrated, the Chief takes their files and turns to leave, but an ornate letter slips out from between the papers. Sumire asks to see the letter, which the Chief allows, suspecting initially that it might have been misplaced by one of the staff members, but then sees that it is addressed to Sumire. As she reads, the Chief sees one sentence: \"The return is nigh. Gather the flowers while you can.\" Sumire, for the first time, breaks from her calm and composed demeanor, looking shocked and going silent. As the Chief attempts to question her further, Nightingale interrupts over the comms, informing them that the FAC commissioner has been found dead. As the Chief departs, they vow to unravel the mystery behind the Garden, but Sumire remains silent.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nThe FAC Commissioner died of heart failure. Though the FAC suspects this is yet another murder done by the Garden, they have no evidence to prove it. You step in and help arrange things so the FAC will leave Sumire alone. After you are done with the tasks at hand, you plan to interrogate her once more.</i></p>","interrogation2":"The Chief awakens from an ominous dream, finding a purple flower growing out of the back of their hand. Sumire is standing over them silently. Quickly deducing that she is here to kill them, they attempt to call for help, but are paralyzed by some form of neurotoxin. Weakly, they manage to ask Sumire about the contents of the letter. Sumire confesses that she had received orders to kill the Chief a long time ago - the letter was simply an ultimatum for her to finish the job.\n\nShe tells the Chief a story from her childhood, through the lens of Nana, her birthname. She tells of how the Mentor recruited her to join the Garden, put her through rigorous training, and ultimately gave her the life she has today. The Chief tries to tell Sumire that the Mentor is using her, to which Sumire replies that she knows, but feels indebted to the Mentor for saving her life. Although allowing herself to be captured as part of her mission, she found that the Mania hallucinations that plagued her disappeared when she was around the Chief. She continued to observe them from a distance, growing to appreciate their approach to Sinners, their kindness, and eventually found that she was no longer able to bring herself to kill them. When she returned to the Mentor to report her failure, the Mentor did not punish her; instead, she sent more assassins to cover for Sumire's mistake.\n\nAfter repeatedly sabotaging attempts on the Chief's life, Sumire grew worried about how the Mentor would respond to her betrayal. As the Garden's top agent, she had hoped that the Mentor might harbor some sentimentality towards her, but the letter proved otherwise: it stated that if she could not complete this mission, the Mentor would do so herself. Sumire tells the Chief that she will leave the Bureau and personally ask the Mentor to revoke the assassination order, stating that meeting the Chief is the luckiest thing that's ever happened to her. As she turns to leave, the Chief manages to stand, but when they attempt to use the Shackles, they stumble and pass out.\n\nWhen the Chief comes to some time later, they see that the room is full of signs of fighting. Checking the security camera footage, they see that Sumire fended off another assassin and procured the antidote to the toxin, injecting it into the Chief and leaving moments before they woke up. Barely able to walk, the Chief uses the Shackles to sense Sumire's location, hobbling out of the Bureau in order to save her from what they assume is certain death.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nThe side effect of that toxic is taking its toll on you as you lose consciousness multiple times. But you understand how important it is to find Sumire. </i></p>","interrogation3":"The Chief tracks Sumire to a large Japanese-style mansion, finding her kneeling in the courtyard and covered in blood. Two female assassins stand over her, and behind them, the Mentor is silhouetted from the other side of a paper screen. Sumire attempts to convince them that the Chief should not be killed, but the Mentor, having already noticed the Chief is among them, gives her one final chance at redemption. Sumire refuses again, then quickly rushes to block an invisible attack on the Chief, severely injuring her. Finally the Mentor acquieses, but demands that Sumire remain with them. Sumire tries to persuade the Chief to leave, but the Chief stands their ground and attempts to use the Shackles to attack the Mentor, only to have their arm disabled by another unseen attack. The Mentor gives them a chance to leave, but instead they choose to hold Sumire's hand. The Mentor asks if this is truly Sumire's decision, warns that she will eventually be betrayed, and the Mentor and the two assassins vanish as the candles behind the screen go out.\n\nWith that, the Chief attempts to leave, but is too weakened to go any further. Sumire opens her parasol for the two of them and they sit beneath a white-flowered tree. The Chief comments that it feels like a dream, and Sumire encourages the Chief to rest, and that when they wake up, it will all be over. Sumire promises to protect the Chief, but the Chief insists that they will be the one to protect her instead. Before their consciousness fades, the Chief promises never to betray her. Sumire acknowledges, looks up at the sky, and says that the moon looks beautiful tonight.\n\nWhen the Chief wakes up in the sickbay, the memories of the previous day are blurred. With Sumire fine and the Garden seemingly laying low, the FAC closes the investigation.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nThe things that happened that night... you have no idea how much of it was true and how much of it was just an illusion. But what matters is that you are safe now.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"Before the arrest, the subject had long been a wanted criminal for a failed attempt to assassinate the Chief, but her whereabouts were elusive. Eventually, the subject was found unconscious and severely injured at the entrance of the MBCC, and was brought in to be treated, arrested and detained.","arrestRec2":"Born in Eastside to unknown parents, the subject was adopted by the leader of the //Garden// and specifically raised to become an assassin. Members of the //Garden// addressed the leader as the //Mentor//.","arrestRec3":"After a brief period of discreet activity as the assassin of the //Garden//, the subject debuted as //Sumire the ikebana artist// in high society. Thanks to her artistry in ikebana, she was fairly well-known among the upper class and had many fans. The subject was able to frequent important occasions with her forged identity which provided convenience for her assassination work.","arrestRec4":"The subject had already quit the organization and ceased ikebana activity before the arrest. During the arrest, the corpses of several assassins also belonging to the //Garden// were discovered near the Bureau and were believed to be on the way to assassinate Chief. The wounds on their bodies matched the shape of Sumire's umbrella blade perfectly.","servingTerm1":"The subject loves planting flowers and has planted various kinds of flowers in the garden to be used as ikebana materials. With extensive knowledge in plant care, barely anyone can top the subject when it comes to gardening skills.","servingTerm2":"With old injuries accumulated from all the years as well as severe headaches and auditory hallucinations, the subject rarely goes out unless it's for executing battle missions. Despite that, the MBCC has never received any special medical requests from the subject. The subject claims that \"she doesn't want the Chief to worry about her.\" ","servingTerm3":"Tea ceremony is another expertise of the subject's after ikebana. In her free time, she's almost never seen without a cup of tea in her hand. Her excellent tea-brewing skills have won her quite a few tea ceremony partners. Other Sinners are very welcome to follow the flower scent to her room and enjoy a tea-drinking session there as her guest. ","servingTerm4":"Every week, she takes a break from visitors for a day and focuses on ikebana. The final product will always appear on the windowsill in the Chief's office the next morning.

Appearing mostly in the dark alley at night, she's been accused of multiple crimes including attacking residents and obscuring their memories. Due to the nature of her ability, her victims' accounts are often dismissed as fiction. Incomplete research shows that she's victimized close to a hundred people.\n\n--\n\nWith Chief's help, the subject has regained partial memories about the Fog Alley case. When her identity was exposed, she often severed all relationships and moved to a new place. It's believed that she aspires to the mundanity of daily life to compensate for the lack of close relationships. Through interactions with Chief, she gradually recognizes the MBCC as her new base and no longer provides her previous extreme services.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\n\r\nHer ability can interfere with others' minds and perception of the past. So far, the recorded direct effect is influencing or altering memories. The duration and effect of the ability depends on the subject's condition. Besides causing mental influence, her shears, made of a material stronger than regular metals, can also deal physical damage.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\n\r\nThe reasons and exact time of power awakening is unknown. The nature of her ability severely hinders the investigation, but judging from the timeline of the spread of the Fog Alley legend, she must have already awakened for some time.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\n\r\nAlthough her physical appearance is normal, her physical abilities are actually far superior to those of ordinary people. It's not immediately apparent, but the subject has long been plagued by hallucinations and her memories show signs of self-interference.","ecbFlavourText":"\"The next customer who needs me... Where will you be...?\"","interrogation1":"Some time after having fled from Sloane Street, Adela is arrested at the next site where the legend of Mad Shears emerges. After attacking numerous MBCC staff, she is brought to the Chief for interrogation. Neither of them remember anything of their meeting in Sloane Street. Adela confirms that she is Mad Shears, but denies any knowledge of the places where Mad Shears has appeared or the attacks that she has committed. The Chief opens Adela’s suitcase and produces evidence of her life in all those different locations, but still can’t detect any signs that she is lying. They realize that Adela has erased her own memory as well. Adela confirms this, saying that it allows her to live freely with perfect peace of mind. In a pocket of the suitcase, the Chief also finds a rusted old key with the address 12 Dorset Street and conclude that it must be where Adela lived before becoming Mad Shears. Although Adela doesn’t understand why that’s significant, the Chief decides to take her there to investigate the beginning of the mystery.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nWhat you didn't expect was that Adela, the culprit in the events of Sloane Street and many more, had even erased her own memories.\nYou need to understand her motives, her starting point.\nTo that end, you initiated a program of investigation.</i></p>","interrogation2":"The Chief and Adela find 12 Dorset Street in a poor neighborhood of Eastside. Adela is skeptically bemused at the Chief's insistence on pursuing this lead, but plays along good-naturedly. The building is long-deserted, but the key works. Inside, the Chief looks around for clues while Adela habitually tidies the dusty apartment. Finding nothing to go on, the Chief resorts to more drastic measures to find answers. They hold Adela's shears, and see the thick hairs of discarded worries grow over the room. They touch the hair and are pulled into Adela's old memories. The Chief and Adela witness that Adela lived at 12 Dorset Street when she was a teenager. Her mother was irresponsible and alcoholic, clearly resentful of her lost youth and of her daughter. She pressured the young Adela to use her looks to become an actress, model, or other high-paying job so that Adela could support her, and ridiculed Adela for saying she wanted to be a hairdresser. Ultimately, Adela left home after they fought over her disapproval of her mother's new fiancé William; having been kicked out, she awakened as a Sinner, felt her hair growing, and cut it off for the first time. With the memories restored to her, Adela defends her decision to sever those worries, and tell the Chief that with them gone, both she and her mother were free to live their own lives without the burden of their codependence. She tries to leave, but the Chief produces more evidence -- a recording from somebody familiar with the residents of that apartment.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nWitnessing Adela's past, the truth has surfaced. But things are far from over.</i></p>","interrogation3":"In the recording, the Chief talks with a waiter at the bar where Adela's mother used to work. The waiter tells them that her name was Mary Anne Kelly, and that she had been a promising ballerina until she became involved with a seedy man who impregnated and then abandoned her. She began working at the bar to support Adela, until she met William, a wealthy Phantom Entertainment executive. William disliked Adela, and when he proposed to Kelly, he said he would send Adela away to boarding school. The waiter recounts how Kelly rejected that idea, but the next day, when the other staff asked her about her daughter, Kelly did not remember her and never mentioned her again. Even without her memories of Adela, Kelly broke up with William shortly after.\n\nAdela listens to the recording of the conversation impassively, as the Chief explains that they think Adela's argument with her mother was the result of miscommunication and that their difficult relationship could have been mended. However, Adela coldly replies that she's beyond caring -- these memories are more like somebody else's than her own. She praises the Chief's desire to help people, but says that she has a better and faster way of resolving her troubles. The Chief is forced to use the Shackles to prevent her from erasing both their memories of these events. Connected by the Shackles, their missing memories of their time together on Sloane Street return to them. Adela weakly acquiesces to the Chief's insistence that she learn how to face her past, rather than instinctively running away, but she doesn't believe that all the memories she's lost can be regained. The Chief promises to find a way.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nAfter Adela fell into a coma, you called for staff of the MBCC to bring you back.\nYou recalled all the things that had happened in Sloane Street, the times you had spent together.\nThis time, you will not forget.</i></p>\n","interrogation4":"Some time has passed, and Adela no longer attacks the MBCC staff. However, she feels restless and claustrophobic in the Bureau, so the Chief arranges for her to have a field day where she gets to work in a hair salon in Eastside. As the Chief planned, Kelly enters the salon with a planted coupon for a free haircut. She doesn't recognize Adela, but Adela knows her; she immediately understands that this was arranged by the Chief, but silently begins to work on Kelly's hair. Meanwhile, Kelly talks about she used to dismiss the value of a hairdresser, but now understands how a good haircut can put you in a good mood. She works at a nursery, and has a difficult time dealing with the young children in her charge. To both her and Adela's surprise, the Chief asks if Kelly has heard of Mad Shears, and suggests that she seek it out so that it can get rid of her worries. Kelly declines, explaining that while the children give her hell, she loves them nonetheless. She says that she sometimes feels like she used to have a daughter, but she believes that she would have made a terrible parent. As Adela finishes the haircut, Kelly begins to cry, though she can't explain why, and apologizes for saying so much. Adela speaks her first words of the encounter, and says that it's part of her job to listen to customers' troubles.\n\nAfter Kelly leaves, the Chief apologizes for springing this on her, but Adela thanks them. She says that she did not understand why the Chief wanted to keep their troubles, but now the hair she has grown because of them feels less like a heavy burden than like a reassuring weight, keeping her anchored. She is excited to continue forward into the future without having to run away.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nHeavy memories can be remembered, and why should the future go on alone.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"During the Fog Alley case, the subject fled after severing all the witnesses' memories about her. She then repeatedly escaped the FAC's arrests and was eventually captured by Chief and brought back to the MBCC.","arrestRec2":"The subject had repeatedly altered others' and her own memories, which seriously impacts her own mental state. It's currently impossible to verify if her obsession with the mundanity of daily life is linked to her past experiences.","arrestRec3":"The investigation shows that the subject lived with her mother since childhood, shouldering most daily chores and tolerating her mother's negative emotions constantly. Her past with her mother could be key to her awakening.","arrestRec4":"For her mother's happiness, the subject trimmed off both her and her mother's memories of each other. In the following years, she //served// her clients with her ability by cutting away their trouble-inducing memories until she was found out. She kept moving homes to protect her daily life, unintentionally spreading the urban legend surrounding her.","servingTerm1":"Though she hasn't shown particular interest in things other than serving clients, she often keeps flowers and fragrances in her cell, calling it a //trick to mask the smell of hair spray//.","servingTerm2":"The subject's highly likable character makes the Sinners and staff lower their guard and open up to her easily. After two attack attempts, the MBCC decided to hold an internal seminar to promote the importance of privacy. In response, Adela claimed that she was only trying to help them. ","servingTerm3":"The subject has transformed her cell into a vintage-style hair salon where she provides various services to the Sinners in the Bureau. Rumor has it that she can produce anything from her counter, and many like to test that theory for fun. But this service has soon been restricted ever since she took out a forbidden weapon from her counter.

Would you mind telling me?\n\n**Adela:** Actually...\n\n**Adela:** I've had this gem pendant for years, but I only found out today that it's in fact a locket with a photo of a young woman hidden inside.\n\n**Adela:** I'm sure it's nothing important, but I somehow feel like I've seen this photo before...\n\n**System Notifications:** You recognize that's Adela's mother.

I'll go back to work now.\n * **Adela:** Remember, you're always welcome at my salon, Chief.\n * **System Notifications:** Perhaps it's not time yet. Watching Adela return to her hair salon humming a melody, you can't help feeling a pang.\n\n* **Prompt:** Perhaps she's someone important to you.\n * **Chief:** She could be someone important to you. Otherwise, why would you have kept her photo for so long?\n * **Adela:** But... I... I'm confused...\n * **Adela:** She's only a stranger... Why do I feel so upset all of a sudden...\n * **System Notifications:** Tears suddenly begin falling from Adela's eyes for some reason even she doesn't comprehend. She seems a bit flustered at first, but soon collects herself.\n * **Adela:** Sorry, Chief. I'm such a mess.\n * **Chief:** ...\n * **Adela:** I should head back to my room and take a rest.\n * **System Notifications:** Adela's steps seem particularly heavy. You watch her back and sigh softly.","nameEN":"Adela","nameKR":"아델라","nameJP":"アデラ","nameCN":"阿黛拉","namePinyin":"Ādàilā","nameRomaji":"Adera","supervision6":"++* ⚠⚠⚠ Trimming\n\n//Your hair seems to be getting a bit too long these days.//\n\n**System Notifications:** Your hair seems to be getting a bit too long these days, but you're not in the mood to either visit a hair salon outside or trim it yourself.

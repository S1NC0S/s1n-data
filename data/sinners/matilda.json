Admirable, for sure, but Nightingale quickly catches on that Matilda is tracking everything down to the tiny detail, like whether Nightingale leads with her left or right foot when stepping out the door.\n\n* **Prompt:** Just let her be...\n\n**Chief:** Just let her learn. If she picks up even just ninety percent of what you know, that's a win for all of us.","supervision2":"++* ‚ö† Neat Freak\n\n//At times, a penchant for cleanliness is a godsend for roommates.//\n\n**System Notifications:** You might've seen how spotless the training room's been lately. Well, turns out, it's all thanks to Matilda's need for neatness.

This isn't sustainable...\n\n**System Notifications:** You've made multiple attempts to get Matilda to ease up, suggesting breaks now and then, but it's like talking to a wall. Whether it's going to see a movie or grabbing some coffee, she's always got an excuse, \"Sorry, I'm booked then.\"\n\n* **Prompt:** Request for help\n\n**Chief:** ...That's the situation. She's all about pre-planned routines and strict adherence. Getting her to pencil in some fun time is a real challenge, and nudging her to switch up her plans on the fly? Near impossible. [[[Tetra]]], got any ideas on how to tackle this?\n\n**Tetra:** Huh... So, you're telling me our job is to swipe some time off the calendar of Miss Perfect Planner? Sounds like a fun little challenge. Let's have a look...\n\n**Chief:** Exactly. Wait, you're already on your phone? Cooking up a scheme to convince Matilda, are you?\n\n**Tetra:** Hmph, obviously. I've got the elite's mindset down to a science. Hit them where it hurts, and you'll see instant results. Anyway, she'll be there for tea with you tomorrow. Just you wait.\n\n**System Notifications:** Try as you might to pry into the details of the convincing, Tetra always says a phantom thief's methods are off-limits to you, but she's sure it'll work. So there you are, half-doubting, half-hoping, in the greenhouse, waiting for some kind of magic to happen.\n\n**Matilda:** Directly ahead, about 15 meters from the door, there's a table with tea and treats... Chief, you got here early too?\n\n* **Prompt:** Surprised and confused\n\n**Chief:** Matilda, you really showed up. Did Tetra say something to you?\n\n**Matilda:** Miss Tetra? Nope, not her. Why would you say that? I'm only here because it was penciled in my planner.\n\n**Chief:** ...Ah, I see now, you're on the default calendar app. Tetra probably hacked in and made some changes... Oops, I mean, afternoon tea wasn't in your original plans, was it? Didn't anything seem off to you?\n\n**Matilda:** Uh, I don't actually remember adding this to my schedule, but maybe it's just a memory slip... In any case, it's best to stick to what's officially on the books.\n\n**Chief:** It's, uh, good to be thorough.

This lady, for some reasons, has been going overboard complimenting my looks and even trying to snag some of my hair.\n\n**Matilda:** The fishy stuff includes her calling me a top-notch beauty and saying she can sniff out a \"crisp, deep\" scent on me. I let her know that I'm not one to fall for fake compliments, and yet she keeps at it.\n\n**Chief:** ...\n\n**Matilda:** She's even spinning a yarn about the Eastside beauty pageant being targeted by crooks. Claims you've tasked her with picking out Sinners for an undercover gig there.\n\n**Matilda:** I've gone through her stuff using the Bureau's guide on suspicious characters and everything's clean, no risks. Right now, I'm just trying to stay one step ahead of her. If you give the word that this is all fake, I can cuff her on the spot.\n\n* **Prompt:** M-Matilda? Is that you for real? What's with the... outfit?\n\n**Matilda:** This dress? Yeah, that lady over there insisted I put it on, claiming \"facts speak louder than words.\" But honestly, I'm not comfortable in it and don't quite get her drift. Chief, why the shocked face?\n\n**Chief:** No, no, it's nothing. Just struck by how good Cassia is at picking the right people... If you're game to hit the contest in that outfit, we won't need to scout anyone else. You'll knock them dead, for sure.\n\n**Matilda:** If it really helps crack the case, then yeah, I won't say no. But what's the deal here...? Is she not lying to me after all...?\n\n**Cassia:** Heh, after seeing how Chief's jaw dropped, you gotta believe me now... You might be clueless about your looks, but my nose knows the truth... Can I have my hair sample now?\n\n**Chief:** Right on, right on.

Sure, they earned their day of fun for playing nice, but why the need to be so noisy?\n\n**System Notifications:** Seeing as the Sinners have been on their best behavior for two weeks straight just for this bit of excitement, you're not about to call it off for a bit of racket. Instead, you choose to go there yourself and ask them to tone it down a notch.\n\n**Chief:** Hey, is that Matilda? Why are you all by yourself with a water gun? Not a fan of water fights?\n\n**Matilda:** Chief? Good to see you. Water fights... you mean, like, spraying each other with toys and stuff? I'm kind of new to this. Just trying to work out the rules by watching from the sidelines.\n\n**Chief:** Water fights are all about having fun, no real rules. But hey, the more you drench others, the better player you are, I guess. With that water gun in your hands, you're already ahead of the game compared to those just using their hands.\n\n**Matilda:** To be honest... I'm not sure I'm up for using it. If you'd like, you can have it.\n\n* **Prompt:** Puzzled\n\n**Chief:** What's up with this water gun? I asked [[[Eureka]]] and [[[Mess]]] to give it a once-over. They've dialed down the power, so it's all safe and fun‚Äîno one gets hurt.\n\n**Matilda:** Nope, that's not it. You're aware of my special power, right? If we're classifying water guns as firearms, wouldn't me joining the water fight be kinda unfair to the other Sinners?\n\n* **Prompt:** Water guns aren't really guns.\n * **Chief:** The one we picked up is super basic, really different from what you'd call a regular gun.\n * **Matilda:** Got it. Well, if that's how it is, I better keep watching for a while longer. Need to figure out everyone else's moves to clinch this win...\n * **Chief:** ...Really, Matilda? Does winning this water fight matter so much to you?\n * **Matilda:** Absolutely. There's no fun in losing. That's been my dilemma‚Äîshould I use my sharpshooting edge to cut down everyone else's shot at winning?\n * **Chief:** But, you know, I think... there aren't really winners in a water fight. Isn't it about who has the most fun? The one having the most fun is closest to winning, I guess. Maybe taking that approach makes it less stressful!\n * **Matilda:** The one having the most fun is closest to winning...? That explains why even the drenched ones are all grins and giggles...\n\n* **Prompt:** It's okay if water guns are guns.\n * **Chief:** You do have an edge on using guns, but in a water fight, it's all about playing to your strengths, right? So, no big deal.\n * **Chief:** You know, you could take it easy, or forget the water gun and just play with splashes... There's more than one way to play!\n * **Matilda:** But holding back... wouldn't that be like not giving the game and everyone else the respect they deserve?\n * **Matilda:** If I had a say, I'd definitely refuse to play a game if my opponent suggests giving me an advantage, like playing with one hand tied. It feels awful to be treated with kid gloves just because you're seen as the weak one. I've been there; I know what it's like.\n * **Chief:** Y-you're making sense. What's your move then?\n * **Matilda:** I'm bringing this gun along. I believe in respecting my rival by going all out to win. Chief, please look forward to my performance in the battle!

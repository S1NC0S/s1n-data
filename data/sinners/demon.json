In the following several years, the subject continued to carry out assaults against officials of the City Council, and was never caught.\n\n--\n\nAn anonymous source reveals that the DisCity Councilor serial murder case contains multiple discrepancies, such as the use of Mania weapons and the severe disfiguring mutation of the corpses. The 9th Agency's investigation has confirmed that the case is related to Parma and corrupt city councilors. The subject suffered a certain degree of false accusation and was followed by hired assassins for several years.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\nWith the strategic shield, hostile attacks can be warded off within a short period and morale of allies can be effectively boosted. These effects are especially effective on Demon himself.\n\n+++* Awakening Signs\nThe subject's ability awakened at the scene of Abel's murder. This case consists of many suspicious details. The reports suggest that the subject erupted in intense rage and hatred at the time, but more details are to be verified in future interrogations.\n\n+++* Corruption State\nAll cognitive assessments and physical examinations have returned normal results. The subject's corruption level is low and his mind is clear, with no physical signs of mutation detected.","ecbFlavourText":"\"I'm sorry Abel. I failed to protect you.\"\n\"I'm sorry Vera. I failed to keep my promise.\"","interrogation1":"Prior to the interrogation, the Chief meets with a city councilor, who explains that a trial will be held for Demon in thirty days. In addition to various files, they receive one last piece of evidence: a small charm bracelet. When asked what it pertains to, the city councilor replies that it should be useful in making Demon talk.\n\nDespite his restraints, Demon's force of presence is extremely intimidating in the interrogation room. As the Chief goes through the list of his victims, including Abel Schilder, his foster father, he bluntly admits to all of his crimes. When asked for his motivations, he replies that they were all done out of revenge, but refuses to elaborate what for. The Chief produces the bracelet, hoping for answers, but Demon suddenly grows violent. He demands to know where they got it, and when the Chief answers that it was the city council, Demon easily breaks his restraints and attempts to attack them. Nightingale, standing behind the Chief, hits Demon with a high power tranquilizer, instantly sedates him. As his consciousness fades, he mumbles the name \"Vera.\"\n\n\n<p style=\"color: white\"><i>Demon's reaction today only adds more mysteries to the case. Though we have enough evidence to prove him guilty, we still have no idea what his motives are.This is especially true considering his unusual reaction to the bracelet at the end. The city council claimed that he was a cold-blooded, murderous psychopath, but what you saw suggested otherwise. Further investigation is required.</i></p>","interrogation2":"Two weeks later, the Chief enters Demon's cell to continue from where the interrogation left off, but he catches them off guard. He knocks them unconscious, kidnaps them, and flees the Bureau. Upon awaking in a dingy apartment room, the Chief, realizing that Demon didn't strip them of their tracking beacon, attempts to question him in an attempt to buy time until backup arrives. Demon explains he while he technically did kill Abel Schilder, he only did so after gangsters broke in and attacked with Mania weapons, causing him to mutate into a Corruptor. Knowing that Abel had upset other politicians in his bid for election, Demon gathers that this was done by the City Council in an attempt to sabotage his campaign. He confirmed this from his tortured victims, all of whom were connected to the Council in some way.\r\n\r\nAs the Chief attempts to break free from their restraints, the bracelet falls out of their pocket. Demon, demeanor softening once again, takes it, and the Chief asks if it belonged to Vera Schilder, Abel's biological daughter. Demon confirms this, saying that he assumes the council has kidnapped her and intends to use her as leverage against him in the trial. Although the Chief tries to convince him that they can help, Demon thanks them for their kindness, saying it won't last long in a world like this, and says that he has to go it alone.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, a member of the 9th Agency interrupts, having already stealthily entered the room some time ago. Although both the Chief and Demon are hesitant to trust him, he explains that he has a plan to turn the trial in their favor, and that all he requires is their cooperation.\r\n\n\n<p style=\"color: white\"><i>An unexpected man, claiming to be a member of the 9th Agency, reveals a plan to you and Demon. Having second thoughts, Demon hesitates to give an answer. Then, Nightingale arrives with forces and puts him down with an anesthesia shot. This time, you make a decision for him. The MBCC raised Demon's security level once more. But you know that this measure is no longer necessary. Demon now cooperates with you willingly. Following the request of that strange man, each of you is now making preparation. The trial day comes as planned.</i></p>","interrogation3":"The day of the trial arrives. The city councilor from before serves as the prosecutor, and as the trial goes on, it is clear from his and the judge's behavior that there was never an intention for this trial to be fair. Even after Demon tries to explain the situation with Vera, the councilor produces testimony speaking out against Demon, supposedly signed by the girl herself. Despite the Chief's best attempts, it seems that the trial is lost.\r\n\r\nThen, the man from the 9th Agency speaks up. He reveals that upon investigating the City Council's involvement with [[[Black Water]]], the Agency discovered that Vera Schilder has been dead for six years. Demon grows despondent as the trial quickly comes to a close, with the Chief realizing that the two of them have played exactly into the 9th Agency's hand. As the 9th Agency attempts to take the judge away, Demon asks why he lied about Vera. He replies, more or less, that it's just how their world works. In a fit of rage, Demon snaps his restraints and slams the judge's head against the floor, killing him instantly. The man from the 9th Agency sighs, warning the Chief that Demon is \"an unstable pawn,\" and the Chief ensures him that this incident will be thoroughly covered up.\n\n<p style=\"color: white\"><i>\r\nNo one expected that the trial would end in such a disastrous way. There is now a purge in the city council, starting from its superior executives to the subordinates. It seems the 9th Agency's work is seeing progress. As for Demon, now that the city council is busy saving its own skin, the MBCC will be his final destination. Carrying the burden of his past sins and the brutal crime of murdering the city council's judge on site, he will have to fight for the MBCC until one day a Corruptor or something more horrible takes his life. There is no parole, no commutation, but only a fate grimmer than death.</i></p>","interrogation4":"Some time later, the MBCC launches a mission to find Vera's remains, and Demon applies to be put on the task force. Despite the other soldiers unwilling to trust him, the Chief's confidence in him has not wavered. As Demon tears apart Corruptors, he collapses a building, shielding him and the Chief from the debris but cutting them off from the rest of the squad. The two investigate the ruins, finding that this matches the location, and discover a room with a closed door, outside of which are clear signs of a prior investigation. The Chief offers that Demon go in alone, but he says he doesn't need the privacy.\r\n\r\nThe two enter the room and find Vera's body, now just a skeleton, along with her notebook. As Demon gathers the remains and says his final prayers, the sound of Corruptors mounts around them, forcing them to flee. Once outside, Demon realizes that they're too close to a residential area, and that if left unattended, the Corruptors will no doubt run rampant. Insisting that the FAC won't arrive in time, Demon demands that the Chief leave him behind to hold them off himself. The Chief promises to return with reinforcements, and as they run off, Demon mumbles that he should just be left to die.\r\n\r\nDemon holds off the swarm in a gory display of his strength, but even for all his abilities and enhanced regeneration, his stamina begins to falter. He starts to be distracted by memories of Abel and Vera; how he met them, conversations that he had with Vera, a surprise party she held for him, how he promised her that he would protect their father. As he fights on, growing weaker, Vera's notebook falls out of his breast pocket, revealing her final letter to him. Although she suspected she would soon be killed, she reaffirmed her love for him, supporting him regardless of the path he took.\r\n\r\nDemon collapses, blacking out. In a blur of semi-unconsciousness, he hears the Chief's voice saying that they came back, that they brought reinforcements. Overcome by his injuries and the weight of his guilt, he does not get up.\n\n<p style=\"color: white\"><i>\r\nDemon is not dead. But no one can bring him salvation.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"The subject escaped the Special Task Force's siege and was on the run for years, during which he violently resisted arrest repeatedly. The MBCC and FAC joined forces to send out a large number of police officers and eventually arrested the subject after making a great deal of sacrifice.","arrestRec2":"Demon Schilder, formerly named Demon Borne, was born in Syndicate. In N.F. 95, Demon was adopted by councilor Abel Schilder and later became a captain of the Special Task Force under the FAC.","arrestRec3":"During the time when he was the FAC's Special Task Force's captain, Demon was proactive with his duties and helped Abel gain support from a considerable portion of Eastside's population. After the incident, the subject was struck off and besieged by the Special Task Force.","arrestRec4":"Investigation shows that the real culprit of Abel's death is an opposition party. During the election speech, Abel was showing signs of mutation after being attacked by a Mania Weapon, and the subject had no choice but to end his life. A family member, Vera Schilder, was kidnapped by Parma lab after the incident, and is now confirmed to be dead.","servingTerm1":"Possesses excellent shooting and wrestling skills and is well-known for that, so is frequently challenged by other Sinners.

He even tries to catch up on those young Sinners' fashion and interests despite finding it very hard to chime in on these discussions.

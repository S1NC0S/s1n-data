She was involved in many violent incidents with Zoya and Earl. She is suspected to be connected with other dangerous and mysterious factions. Irritable and belligerent, she presents a major threat to Syndicate's social stability.\n\n--\n\nThe subject is naturally combative and often gets into trouble. After the great riot, she became even more violent under the Deus Corpus' control. Fortunately, since the Square Black Ring incident, her moods and character have undergone certain changes. She's become significantly less aggressive and more stable and she has a firmer grasp over her power.\n\nHer leadership has grown more prominent ever since she took part in the mission against the Public Security Bureau remnants' attack on the Legion. The Bureau currently trains her specifically in that aspect.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\nMaking use of the Battle Mark on her arm to wield her heavy battleaxe, her destructive capabilities are not to be underestimated. The Battle Mark grows in strength given the right circumstances, further enhancing her combat abilities.

Her claim has been corroborated multiple times, and is considered legitimate.\n\n+++* Corruption State\nIssues with her height make her short-tempered, manifesting in changes to her Battle Mark pattern due to her special powers. Her psychological evaluation, however, comes out clean. More observation is required to determine the extent of her corruption.","ecbFlavourText":"\"The Legion hasn't fallen yet. We must survive to find Zoya and restore our former glory.\"\n\"Yes we can...\"","interrogation1":"Two weeks after the events surrounding BR-004, the Chief and Nightingale discuss the unusual nature of the Public Security Bureau's counterattacks against the Legion. The Chief theorizes that they may be looking for something specific -- or someone. They decide to question Horo, who was supposedly sent to the MBCC by the Legion for her own protection. Still heavily injured, Horo is quiet and compliant, confirming that she does not know Zoya's whereabouts. She inquires about the Legion's well-being, and the Chief quickly recaps the events of Keylan Square, including Earl's death and Zoya's disappearance, watching as Horo's face grows dark. Horo says that this is the first she's heard of either, and that the Legion told her that Zoya and Earl were still fighting.\n\nThe mood in the interrogation room grows heavy. Horo realizes that the situation in the Legion is dire, and the Chief confirms this. The Chief then asks if Horo knows anything that the Public Security Bureau would want to keep covered up, and she quickly replies that she does. While being detained, she overheard members of the Public Security Bureau discussing Mania weapon trade with representatives of Parma, saying that she might be able to recall some of their names if she had access to Earl's notebooks. The Chief quickly calls Nightingale to arrange for transportation, but Horo warns them that Earl likely hid his them somewhere that not even the Legionnaires know. She asks to accompany the Chief on the mission, and the Chief, noting how much she's grown since they met not long ago, accepts her offer. With even that much evidence, the 9th Agency will be able to get involved.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The only way to resolve the Legion's crisis is to go on the offensive.</i></p>","interrogation2":"The Chief assembles a small strike force to case all of the Legion's strongholds. After talking with Legionnaires named Lenny and Jer, Horo and the Chief find nothing in Earl's room. Horo suggests that they try the trailer park, the long-abandoned place where Earl and Horo first lived after joining the Nirvana Convoy. Worried for her safety, Jer gathers a small group of Legionnaires to protect Horo. Together with Hella and Hecate, they return to the siblings' former home.\r\n\r\nAfter hours of searching through Earl's documents, the Chief pulls a solemn Horo aside and attempts to comfort her. Horo insists that she's not a child, calling the Chief's attempts at reassurance clumsy like her brother's. She says that she's endured many losses, including the deaths of her mother and father, and is haunted by the helplessness she felt when Earl was brought home with a missing leg. Unable to help ease his pain, she joined to Convoy to help lighten his load in other ways, but Earl always kept her from doing more. This led to a fracture in their relationship, and Horo ultimately stopped talking to Earl altogether. She cries for all the days she's kept herself from doing so, unable to keep her emotions together.\r\n\r\nAfter some further reminiscence, she remembers Earl's propensity for hiding things. Pulling open a false bottom to a desk drawer, she finds the materials they were looking for. One of the MBCC operatives expresses regret at Earl not telling them the location sooner, and Horo replies that regret is meaningless. The Chief gathers the team to retreat, only to be cut off by the remnants of the Public Security Bureau, a hundred strong and armed to the teeth with Mania weapons.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Enemies incoming. Prepare to fight.</i></p>","interrogation3":"Faced with insurmountable odds, the Chief decides to act as bait alongside Hella to allow Horo and the others injured to escape. Horo gives them a quiet but commanding rejection, unwilling to to let others die around her again. Her confidence boosts morale among Legionnaires and Sinners alike, granting them the courage to stand their ground. The group soon begins to cut through the siege line, forcing the Public Security Bureau to bombard the trailer park with molotov cocktails. As their leader takes aim at the last remaining escape route, Horo appears above him, striking him down with a new axe assembled from scrap metal. She gives the order to charge, all of her ragtag soldiers descending on the enemy, and the Chief seizes the opportunity to get Horo to safety.\r\n\r\nNow a good distance from the burning trailer park, Horo and the Chief reunite with the Legionnaires, led by Jer, who confirms that there were no casualties thanks to their leadership. Horo assures them that once this is over, they won't have to fight any more, and Jer adds that they can always return to the logistics days of the Convoy. Relieved, Horo collapses, but the Chief catches her before she hits the ground. Jer says that he's always seen Horo as a child, prompting Horo to say that she isn't one any more. This time, Jer sincerely agrees, reaffirming what Zoya once said to him -- that Horo will be the one to take up her torch. Horo denies this, saying that Zoya will return one day, but in the mean time, she and the Chief will keep the Legion out of trouble.\r\n\r\nIn the car on the way back to the Bureau, Langley calls and tells the Chief where to hand off the evidence to one of her agents. The man informs the Chief that after the events of today, the Public Security Bureau will soon cease to exist. The Chief returns to the driver's seat to find Horo smiling in her sleep, teary-eyed, and mumbling Earl's name.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The Legion's crisis has been resolved. Through this series of events, Horo has grown into a worthy leader. She is now strong enough to hold down the fort before Zoya comes back.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"Fell prey to a scavenger trap and was captured by sheriffs. Caught a lucky escape during the MBCC riot.

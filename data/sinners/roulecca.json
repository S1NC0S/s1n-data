Initiated in total several dozen serial explosions and shootings in the name of //rising to the top of Syndicate//, causing several hundred casualties.\n\nFrequenting all major casinos over the years, the subject's abnormally high winning rate and uninhibited character often attracted grudge. It's suspected that the subject asked for trouble intentionally and more violent incidents may result if the subject is not properly controlled.\n\n--\n\nInteractions and counseling with the subject reveal that she witnessed the murder of her father and his gang members at a young age, which awakened the power and she defended herself with it. Evidence shows that the victims of the serial explosions and shootout were all rival gang members and no civilians were harmed in the incident. With Chief's further counseling and company, the subject has gradually rectified her petulant character.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nPossesses eerily strong luck and will almost never get hit by fatal objects like bullets, knives, and explosives. Able to control the development of things according to her will. Uses a Colt Python revolver habitually and never misses a target without having to aim, relying solely on her special power.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nThe first recorded energy fluctuation occurred during a fight between two gangs in Syndicate. During the fight, the subject was apparently severely shaken mentally and had an awakening triggered by an intense urge to revenge. More details are to be obtained in further interrogations.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nIn early assessments, the subject was misdiagnosed due to the intense vengefulness unfitting for the age. It's now been confirmed that the subject's mental state is normal and no apparent signs of corruption have been detected. Blessed by the //strong luck//, the mutating speed is way slower than that in normal people to the point of almost negligible.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Roulecca will always be the luckiest among us.\"\n\"You will survive... you will survive...\"","interrogation1":"Roulecca's handcuffs have already fallen off by the time the Chief enters the interrogation room, a testament to the power of her Sinner ability. Nightingale had already provided the Chief with a few other notable examples from Roulecca's file, including that she survived an attack that killed the rest of her gang, the Four-Leaf Clovers. The file also mentions that Roulecca likes to play a game called \"roulette,\" a clear analogue of Russian roulette, and attempts to do so with the Chief in lieu of the usual interrogation format. She agrees to answer a question truthfully for each shot the Chief survives as long as the Chief agrees to do the same for her. The Chief readily agrees, and thanks to Nightingale's warning, produces a rigged replica revolver modeled expertly after Roulecca's own.\n\nHaving arrested Roulecca in close proximity to the Unclaimed Crypt, the Chief suspects Roulecca may be connected with the gangs that opposed The Legion. It becomes clear, however, that Roulecca is not, nor does she appear to be strongly aligned with The Homeless. Instead, she seems more interested in the gangs themselves and the source of their Mania weapons. On the fifth shot -- the Chief's turn -- Roulecca reveals that she smuggled her real gun into the interrogation room and swapped the two revolvers. The Chief survives despite the switch and Roulecca reveals her true intention: to take revenge on the gangs that killed her own. To ensure that she gains all the information she needs, she takes back the gun containing the sixth and fatal shot, puts the barrel to her temple, and fires. The bullet explodes in the chamber, injuring her only slightly, scattering a list of names associated with [[[Black Water]]] that the Chief had brought into the room. After the Chief lets slip that the names belong to suspicious individuals, Roulecca takes it and allows herself to be taken away by EMTs.  With a solid lead on her next target, she promises to meet the Chief again in Syndicate.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>She eventually got the list from you, anyway. Yous hould've realized this earlier. She approached you on purpose because you had something that she wanted. Her right hand is wounded. You should seize this chance and reinforce her room to prevent her from escaping the MBCC.</i></p>","interrogation2":"After blowing her way out of her cell, Roulecca carves a warpath through Syndicate, killing most of the names on the list. The Chief leads Hecate and a squadron after her via the Shackles, her weak signal implying she is on the verge of death. In a last ditch effort to save their potential informants, the Chief and Hecate spread out to increase their odds. The Chief finds her first, and after she kills another one of their leads, attempts to persuade her to abandon her quest for revenge.\n\nRoulecca explains that she views her awakening as a direct result of watching her family members die in front of her; they are a reminder of what she has lost and all that she has left. As revenge is the only thing she has left to live for, she asks the Chief to allow her to continue. As she limps away, an injured gangster throws a bomb filled with poison gas at them. While the Chief manages to keep Roulecca from harm, they are injured in the explosion. Coupled with inhalation of noxious fumes, they quickly fall unconscious.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>After quite some effort, you finally found an exhausted Roulecca. To save her, you took a shot for her that would've been fatal.\nPoisonous gas is everywhere in the air. You take off your coat and use it to cover Roulecca's mouth and nose. You will only have a chance to survive if she's alive too.</i></p>","interrogation3":"In their dreams, the Chief sees Roulecca's final moments with her father: how he promised to gift her the revolver she had coveted for so long, how she stumbled out of the wardrobe into room full of her dead family, the revolver still in the hand of her father's corpse. When they awake, Nightingale informs them that it is the fifth day since the operation. Thanks to Roulecca managing to procure an antitoxin, they will recover in only a handful of days. After she leaves, the Chief goes to open the window, only to find Roulecca pressed against the glass outside.\n\nRoulecca has been visiting the Chief every day in recovery. The two have continued their earliier game, albeit with lower stakes -- Roulecca's lateness earns her a loss. She tells the Chief that when she played games with her family, she often feeling like the luckiest child in the world. The Chief asks if she's always had her luck, and Roulecca admits that her family spoiled her, that for many years, her \"luck\" was a lie told to make her feel even more loved. As she starts to get lost in her regrets, the Chief brings her back to reality, betting her that she will no longer take revenge alone. The two make a promise to take down the gangsters together, only to be interrupted a moment later by Nightingale, calling to inform the Chief that Roulecca has escaped from confinement. Exasperated, the Chief yells after Roulecca as she escapes out the window.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Roulecca has never lied to you. Her \"good luck\" is indeed a result of her \"spoiling\" family.\nHowever, here at the MBCC, you will spoil her no further. Instead, you will correct some of her bad habits.\nExcept that... it is a bit difficult to actually get it done.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"During the investigation of a serial explosion case with unknown cause, the subject requested temporary protection from the MBCC.

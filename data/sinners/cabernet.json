  "interrogation1": "Carley and Greg, the two humans considered Cabernet's favorite ingredients and who were used to create McGrath's mermaid, are still in intense psychiatric care under [[[framework against catastrophe |FAC]]] custody. The Chief arrives to visit them and finds a tense situation -- Greg is threatening to kill himself, believing that if he is gone, Cabernet will no longer be interested in Carley. The Chief and the FAC officers present are able to talk him down, but the two are still inconsolable. They talk circularly about each needing the other to say that they don't love them anymore or otherwise break the bond between them so that Cabernet will let them go. The FAC clerk reports that they spent a long stretch of time confined in Cabernet's basement, but that the deep level of trauma they share goes far beyond simple kidnapping and abuse. They seem to have lost their sense of self, and despite the Chief's repeated reassurances, are incapable of believing that they are safe from Cabernet.\n\nIn order to learn what damage she inflicted on them, the Chief leaves to interrogate Cabernet.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Carley and Greg's fear of Cabernet far exceeds your estimates, you can't get much useful information out of them. You're only hoping that the upcoming one-on-one interrogation can lead you to the truth.</i></p>",
  "interrogation2": "Cabernet tells the Chief about how she grew up in extreme wealth, which made normal luxuries unremarkable, but the Chief isn't interested. She skips ahead to discuss how she became \"a slave to gourmet food\", and explains that unlike everything else in her life, just spending more money can't guarantee better food. She compares good food to fine art, drawing parallels to how they're both frequently a matter of individual taste, and cheap but creative work can greatly surpass the most expensive and luxurious. Thus, despite being ordinary people, Carley and Greg became Cabernet's favorite food because of the depth of their love for each other, and Cabernet tells the Chief about how she would torment them with frequent promises to release one or the other, keeping them \"simmering in a stock of despair.\" She also tells the Chief that she doesn't possess any way to cure them of their current condition. The interrogation is interrupted as [[[Nightingale]]] informs the Chief that Greg has asked to see Cabernet.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>This is your first private meeting with Cabernet after the end of that banquet.\nFrom being partners in retrieving the \"treasures\", to the current relationship as Chief and Sinner, will she stil honestly tell you about her past?</i></p>",
  "interrogation3": "Greg recalls the time before he and Carley became Cabernet's ingredients. They had moved to Eastside from [[[Syndicate]]] and were struggling to make ends meet. Carley worked for the Francs as a servant, while Greg was an aspiring chef discriminated against because of his Syndican origins. Despite having graduated with distinction from the DisCity Blue Ribbon Culinary School, he was unable to get jobs anywhere aside from roadside diners until Carley encouraged him to apply to be Cabernet's private chef. At the application, Cabernet insulted his food, angering Carley; she expects to be fired, but to her surprise, Cabernet becomes enamored with her. Their shared passion, displayed at that moment, begins Cabernet's obsession with consuming their souls. Greg also remembers that after he and Carley were freed from the mermaid at Ogygia Villa, Cabernet gave him a cluster of his own soul grapes. Greg realizes that by feeding his own soul to Carley, they can escape from Cabernet, as she'll have no interest in him without his soul or in Carley once her soul is tainted by greed.\n\nThe Chief arrives at their hospital room with Cabernet, too late to stop Greg from force-feeding his soul to Carley. As Greg collapses, the Chief accuses Cabernet of making him do this, but she denies it. She did help him extract his soul, but she never forced him to make this choice. As the Chief suspects, Cabernet confirms that she did this all for their benefit, stoking their anger and righteousness in order to make their soul even more delicious to her. But as the Chief berates her, Cabernet tells them that the main course hasn't yet been served. She directs their attention to Carley, who remarks with surprise that the grapes she ate tasted just like her favorite dish that Greg used to make. As the Chief watches, Carley becomes ravenous for more.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>To prevent conflict, you rush to where Carley and Grey are with Cabernet. But on the way, Cabernet suddenly smiles as if everything has been settled.\n\"It's too late, little Chief... You can't save everyone.\"</i></p>",
  "interrogation4": "Carley tries to stop the guards from removing Greg's body, forcing the Chief to have her restrained. The Chief is struck by their own helplessness as she frantically calls for more souls to eat. Cabernet exults in the anger she's provoked in them, and comments on the pity the Chief has for Carley versus the disgust they now show for her. The Chief retorts that this is because Carley was forced to become this way, whereas Cabernet fed on souls willingly. Their argument makes Carley notice the purity of the Chief's soul, and she suddenly lunges forward to attack them, a rush of Mania allowing her to overpower the guards. Cabernet throws herself in front of Carley's knife and is deeply stabbed. While the Chief treats her wound, Cabernet tells them that regardless of how the Chief feels about her, they understand her. She encourages them to continue stoking her desire for their soul while stopping her from feeding, so that she can continue watching it ripen.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>You couldn't stop the tragedy between Carley and Greg from escalating, but at least there's still room for recovery. It's time to end this passive situation where you're the pawn.</i></p>",

Driven by professional spirit, you decide to investigate.\n\n**Chief:** Supervision System, please help me locate Cabernet.\n\n**Chief:** ...?!\n\n**Chief:** What's going on?\n\n**System Notifications:** The Supervision System shows you Cabernet's location on the screen, she's in Kelvin's room.\nShe has her back towards the camera, seemingly cornering Kelvin.\nYou rush to the scene and find Kelvin trembling in the shadows.\n\n**Kelvin:** Please, don't eat me...\n\n**Cabernet:** Ah, dear little chef, your cooking leaves much to be desired, it is quite a dilemma.\n\n**Cabernet:** Although the food is poor, it seems your taste is... rather good. Come, let me have a taste, just a bite...\n\n* **Prompt:** No! Stop!\n * **Chief:** Cabernet! Stop it right now!\n * **System Notifications:** The scene in front of you is shocking. In desperation, you rush forward, using all your strength to separate these two Sinners. In order to prevent Cabernet from attacking further, you quickly stand in front of Kelvin.\n * **Cabernet:** Oh? If it isn't Chief?\n * **Cabernet:** I'm very fond of you, Chief... but you see, interrupting a lady during her meal is quite impolite.\n * **Chief:** You promised me you wouldn't attack other Sinners, Cabernet!\n * **Cabernet:** Hmm? I seem to have said something like that... But just like you can't stop a person from breathing, my appetite is the same.\n * **Cabernet:** Ah, forget it, I can miss one meal.\n * **Cabernet:** But, Chief, in exchange, you must agree to one condition.\n * **Chief:** ...Why do I get the feeling this was your real goal all along?\n * **Cabernet:** Hehe, it's just a tiny request.\n * **Cabernet:** Please don't miss any of my dinners for a month, Chief.\n * **Chief:** Alright, I knew it...\n\n* **Prompt:** Grapes!\n * **System Notifications:** You spot a bunch of grapes on the fruit plate on the table next to you. In your haste, you just pick one without thinking and stuff it into Cabernet's mouth.\n * **Cabernet:** ...Mm!\n * **System Notifications:** Cabernet quickly releases Kelvin, who is already scared stiff, and starts chewing the grape in her mouth while trying to maintain her elegance. Once she finishes the grape, she looks at you with a smirk.\n * **Cabernet:** I never expected you to do something... so... barbaric, Chief.\n * **Chief:** Um... I'm sorry, Cabernet, but attacking other Sinners is prohibited here.\n * **Cabernet:** Even though you are Chief, I have to say this.\n * **Cabernet:** Not only do you not allow your Sinners to \"try new flavors,\" but you also use barbaric methods to stop it!\n * **Cabernet:** I'm very disappointed in you, Chief.",

However, Cabernet is very satisfied with this situation. Unable to refuse her warm invitation, you are having dinner with her.\n\n**Cabernet:** What a lovely evening, Chief.\n\n**Cabernet:** Having you dine with me is truly an honor.\n\n**Chief:** But haven't we been eating together these past few days?\n\n**Cabernet:** Hehe, but not every day can we dine in such peace.\n\n**Chief:** That's true...\n\n**System Notifications:** You see Cabernet examining you again. This isn't the first time, but she seems particularly interested in you today.\n\n**Cabernet:** Chief... may I say something?\n\n**Chief:** Yes?\n\n**Cabernet:** Chief, I smell something on you that doesn't belong to you.\n\n**Cabernet:** Anxiety, shampoo, coffee, hand soap... and bleach.\n\n**Cabernet:** These smells are quite unpleasant and don't suit you. Please, come with me.\n\n**System Notifications:** She decisively walks away from the table, leaving behind a table full of dinner, and takes you to her room. Cabernet takes out from a small box two small bottles with gorgeous decorations and exquisite craftsmanship.\n\n**Cabernet:** Chief, allow me to present you with a gift.\n\n**Cabernet:** Please choose one.\n\n* **Prompt:** The metal bottle in sky-blue.\n * **System Notifications:** You pick up the sky-blue metal bottle. The cold touch gives you a sense of calm. You unscrew the cap and a faint floral fragrance comes from the nozzle.\n * **Cabernet:** A very good choice, Chief. Although both bottles of perfume are treasures in my collection, the one you chose is indeed the most suitable for you.\n * **System Notifications:** You press the nozzle into the air next to you, and a light blue mist carrying the scent of daisies, holly, and sandalwood surrounds you.\n * **Cabernet:** I've always believed that scent leads to a person's soul, it determines the first impression others have of you.\n * **Cabernet:** The scent of holly gives a refreshing feeling, like the first sunlight after heavy snow, which is exactly the impression you usually give.\n * **Cabernet:** The middle note is the scent of daisies and white flowers, just as I thought... which represent purity and innocence.\n * **Cabernet:** And the base note that runs through the whole scent is sandalwood. Deep and mysterious... couldn't be more suitable for you.\n * **Chief:** Your understanding of scents is really no less than your understanding of cooking.\n * **Cabernet:** Of course. In my humble opinion, cooking and the soul of a person have commonalities, and your soul, Chief, is like a dish that has not yet been cooked...\n * **Cabernet:** It needs some spices to assist.\n * **Chief:** I appreciate your high regard for me, but your analogy is quite unsettling.\n * **Cabernet:** Haha, just take it as a joke, Chief.\n\n* **Prompt:** The glass bottle filled with bright yellow liquid.\n * **System Notifications:** You pick up the glass bottle filled with bright yellow liquid. The warm color of the liquid attracts you, you unscrew the cap, and a faint fragrance comes from the nozzle.\n * **Cabernet:** Ah, although it's a bit surprising, it's also an extremely suitable perfume for you. It's a valuable one in my collection.\n * **System Notifications:** You try to spray a small amount of perfume on your wrist, and immediately a warm yet gentle fragrance is released.\n * **Cabernet:** I've always believed that scent leads to a person's soul, it determines the first impression others have of you.\n * **Cabernet:** The base of this perfume is the scent of cinnamon and Paradeisos lily. In other words, no matter the top, middle, or base note, you can always smell the pure, affectionate, and loving scent.\n * **Cabernet:** Orange flower, kucha tea, and myrrh are the interpretations of the theme, it's about tolerance, pity, and protection.\n * **Cabernet:** It can also be selfless and unconditional love. It's like you, isn't it?\n * **Chief:** I... I'm at a loss for words for the moment.\n * **Cabernet:** I'm accurate when it comes to judging people, and Chief, this scent represents you.\n * **Cabernet:** No matter how beautiful and honorable a soul is, it needs to be explored with spices and scents... That's something I've always believed in. This is true for people and even more so for cooking.\n * **Cabernet:** I'm looking forward to the day you \"mature.\"",

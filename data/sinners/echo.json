The clamorous noise the subject played and the Mania she unintentionally released caused the M-value in the surroundings to surge. Her behavior violated the city's public security regulations and posed a certain threat to the public. The subject should be detained as soon as possible.\n\n--\n\nUpon interrogation, it was discovered that the subject's self-misperception was rather a result of rare physiological defects and living environment than a self-conscious decision. Under Chief's patient guidance, she now has a better understanding of herself and has begun professional treatment. Her threat to the public is evaluated to have been greatly reduced.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\nThe discordant noise and melodies the subject plays with a musical instrument can cause a certain degree of mental contamination in others.

On the brink of death, she heard a saxophone music coming from a theater.

Don't underestimate me. I can recite the entire score book for you! \n * **Echo:** 😏😏😏\n\n* **Prompt:** I like something more niche, it might be a bit challenging. \n * **Echo:** Are you trying to make things difficult for me?

Every day when she goes out, she carries all her \"property\" with her.\n\n* **Prompt:** You don't have to do this anymore, your room will always be yours.","supervision2":"++* ⚠ Too Much Optimism\n\n//Echo's optimism usually rubs off on others, but it can also have the opposite effect.//\n\n**System Notifications:** Echo meets a staff member at the door of the Chief's office. He has a lot of late clock-in records that need the Chief's signature to make up. The staff member is somewhat anxious and uneasy, and dares not go in to find the Chief. Echo encourages him to be bold.\n\n**Staff Member:** With such a terrible clock in record... ah, I might as well not clock in at all from the start.\n\n**Echo:** Right! Just go to work without clocking in, then there won't be any late records!\n\n**Staff Member:** ...I still want this job at the Bureau.","supervision3":"++* ⚠ Top Student...?\n\n//It doesn't take long for Echo's serious lack of balance in her studies in different subjects to be exposed.//\n\n**System Notifications:** After joining the Bureau, Echo ranked first in three consecutive exams, answering all the memory test questions correctly, and was unrivaled for a while.

Quickly, before anyone reports you for being too loud, close the door... Huh? Why is the door closed? What are you doing here?\n\n**[[[Eleven]]]:** Oh, Chief is here too? You might have misunderstood something, Echo isn't practicing, I asked her to play the songs she knows for me to listen to, so I can choose a few suitable ones for the program...\n\n**Echo:** That's right! Hehe, I'm going to have my own special program, although it's not a live performance, it's the first step to becoming a household name! Echo! The Star!\n\n**Echo:** Probably because a knowledgeable adult finally noticed Echo, she got a little excited and her voice was a bit louder than usual... But it's okay, this is Echo's free performance, everyone will feel like they're getting a bargain!\n\n* **Prompt:** Can't believe it.\n\n**Chief:** ...Eleven, are you serious? Your radio program is broadcast late at night, right? Shouldn't you choose some... softer music?\n\n**Eleven:** Hehe, that's what I initially thought too... If it wasn't for Echo's confident recommendation for me to give it a try, I wouldn't have discovered such a demand...\n\n**Chief:** What kind of demand is it that wants to listen to Echo's saxophone recordings in the middle of the night...\n\n**Echo:** Hey, Eleven is my talent scout! She wouldn't lie, Echo's performances are really popular with the audience!\n\n**Echo:** If you're so doubtful, why don't you give it a try yourself!

The bacon is also very delicious! Auntie, can I have another... no, five plates?\n\n* **Prompt:** Greet\n\n**Chief:** Good morning, Echo, you always have such a big appetite in the morning, it's really enviable.\n\n**Echo:** Because the Bureau's food is delicious! I could eat this delicious food all day, every day, and finish all of Auntie's stock!\n\n**System Notifications:** You thought her words were just rhetorical, so you laughed and sat down next to her. By the time you finish your coffee, Echo has already devoured three plates of fried eggs, bacon, and beans like a whirlwind.\n\n**Chief:** ...\n\n**Chief:** It seems like the lunch menu also suits your taste... I remember you have a few records of visiting the infirmary. Were those times because you overate and made your stomach sick?\n\n**Echo:** Hmm, I'm not sure why my stomach hurts, the doctor mentioned something about eating less but more frequently. I don't understand, if I eat less, wouldn't I be hungry! Besides, I love all the food that Auntie in the cafeteria makes!\n\n**System Notifications:** You remember, the cafeteria lady subtly mentioned once, Echo had eaten someone else's food. Perhaps, children who have starved don't have much control over their appetite.\n\n**Chief:** I'll have to remind the cafeteria lady to make a bit more...\n\n**Chief:** Echo, from now on, I'll accompany you to eat whenever I'm free. If I'm not free, just grab anyone to eat with you.\n\n**Echo:** Chief, do you think I eat too much?\n\n**Chief:** No, it's not about the food, we can afford to feed you in the Bureau. Someone has to be there to remind you about diet control.\n\n**Chief:** I want you to find someone to eat with because, isn't it more fun to eat delicious food with someone?\n\n**Echo:** Hmm... That makes sense! Besides, I've figured out all the delicious dishes in the cafeteria! The typhoon shelter prawns are fragrant and fresh, the steak is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, I've never eaten meat this delicious before. Just dipping in the leftover sauce from the dish, I could eat a basket of bread!\n\n**Echo:** I can recommend all the delicious dishes to everyone! 10 out of 10!\n\n**Chief:** Yes, people who eat with Echo will definitely enjoy their meal.\n\n**System Notifications:** After a while, you go to inquire about the situation. Due to Echo's relentless efforts in finding dining partners, the cafeteria's dining rate has increased. Echo no longer appears in the infirmary with an overfull stomach.","supervision6":"++* ⚠⚠⚠ Love is Blind\n\n//In Echo's eyes, her saxophone is always perfect, for better or worse.//\n\n**[[[Demolia]]]:** Who would've thought that to repair this piece of junk, it would cost so many DisCoins?

Hmm? What you're holding, why does it look like Echo's saxophone?\n\n**Demolia:** Chief, you can recognize it too? Sigh, why did I have to stumble upon it... Well, one should bear the consequences of one's actions, the book says, if you don't bear the responsibilities you should, both garbage and good fortune will run away!\n\n**Chief:** ...I think I understand some of it... You didn't happen to pick up Echo's saxophone that she left there while scavenging for trash, did you?\n\n**Demolia:** That's exactly what happened! Luckily, someone reminded me on the way, or else I wouldn't have known it belonged to that little girl Echo... I even accidentally damaged it! I really owe her an apology...\n\n**Chief:** It wasn't your intention, and you've taken responsibility and paid for the repairs, I don't think Echo will blame you, after all, ignorance is not a crime. But you ought to be more careful in the future.\n\n**Demolia:** I understand, I will be careful in the future! But what should I do now? Leave it where it was and wait for her to come? Or find her and apologize to her directly?\n\n* **Prompt:** Leave it where it was\n * **Chief:** Just put it back where it was, it'll be easier for her to find.\n * **System Notifications:** Just as Demolia had put down the saxophone, Echo came running back with a stack of stage design drafts.\n * **Echo:** Huh, did \"Kute\" get shinier? There must be a fan who took the opportunity when Echo went to see the stage decoration to secretly help me polish \"Kute\"!\n * **Demolia:** Ah, actually it was my fault, just now I...\n * **Echo:** Hmm, I tried blowing it, and sure enough, the \"Kute\" blessed with the love of fans can help me reach new heights! Thank you, unknown fan!\n * **Chief:** ...Should you tell her it actually sounds even more ear-piercing... Speaking of which, the saxophone should be fixed, right...? Why does the sound feel even more exaggerated than before...\n\n* **Prompt:** Tell Echo directly\n * **Chief:** Just go find her directly, it shows more sincerity.\n * **Demolia:** ...That's what happened! I'm sorry, I've already paid for the saxophone to be repaired, if you're still angry, just hit me a couple of times!\n * **System Notifications:** To your surprise, Echo doesn't get particularly excited because her saxophone was messed with by someone else. Instead, she looks a bit puzzled at the instrument Demolia hands her.\n * **Echo:** Did Kute really break down once? It still seems as adorable as before! Let me try tuning it.\n * **Chief:** Is that okay, Echo? We've heard your new composition, it should perform normally, right?\n * **Echo:** New composition? No, this is the march I've played for you before, I've played it several times. You always said it was particularly good. How could you forget?\n * **Chief:** Is it that song...? Although it sounded like noise the previous times, the tune this time is completely different... Could it be the saxophone...?\n * **Demolia:** Hey, don't look at me, I know nothing about this.

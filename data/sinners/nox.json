She hints that the next step to understand more is to interrogate NOX, whom she calls \"the //living person// closest to the truth of DisSea.\"\n\nWhen the Chief enters the interrogation room, NOX immediately asks if they need \"saving\", although their end is still far away. Unperturbed by the strange question, the Chief questions her about the urban legend of the //Sinner Grim Reaper//. Although she is mostly unresponsive to questioning, NOX does not deny that identity, and says that although she has never called herself by that name, she likes it. When asked about her victims' last words, a cloud of gray mist pours out of her and the room echoes with the sounds of desperate, fearful cries from people about to die. Nox explains that she killed people because she heard the voices in their hearts that they wanted to survive; when the Chief responds angrily, she continues that that \"the barrier has to be removed, in order to resist the summoning of DisSea\" -- she is adding their souls to her own collective will because individual spirits are too feeble on their own.\n\nNOX suddenly becomes disturbed and cries that the Chief is dangerous and must be saved. The gray mist flows out of her again, and the Chief attempts to stop her with the [[[Shackles]]] but is mentally rebuffed by the screaming voices of the dead. They experience a montage of scenes where they take the place of a person who, already near death but desperate to survive, sees NOX appear and is killed by her. After three deaths, the Chief finds themself walking on an infinitely long lakeside, surrounded by shadows. The shadows sense the Chief's living soul and attack, so they flee into a nearby building where they find a hospital ward housing a young blonde girl dressed in white, staring out the window at the red moon. The moment she turns to look at them, the shadows swarm in from outside and drag the Chief into darkness.\n\nThe Chief awakens back in the interrogation room; NOX has been taken away.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nThe situation with NOX is complicated. But you see much more significant potential from that girl.</i></p>","interrogation2":"[[[Nightingale]]] and the Chief theorize that the blonde girl at the lake is the original owner of NOX's body, and the core that the dead spirits have attached to. They plan to guide her to regain control of the body, which they hope would neutralize the threat that NOX poses to other Sinners and to the MBCC. Nightingale exposits that //Lakeside Residence//, the building seen in the illusion, was a sanatorium built in N.F. 61 on the south coast of DisSea, 23 years before the [[[DisSea Explosion]]].\r\n\r\nThe Chief uses the Shackles to create a link with NOX and reappears at the lakeside. The girl explains that she has been at the sanatorium for 6 years, suffering from a rare condition with only one other case in DisCity. A few years ago she couldn't even walk on her own, but she has improved since -- although her eyes the past two years have not been able to see clearly. The Chief attempts to read some letters for her, but the contents are covered by gray mist. She is saddened that her friends have not visited in a long time, but remains strong by looking forward to the sunrise -- a sunrise which the Chief knows will never come in this illusory world. The Chief asks if she would accept a way to cure herself if it meant taking the lives of others, and she refuses at first, but quickly becomes confused, recalling dreams where she has murdered many people. The shadows all around become agitated, reminding her of a promise that they made and clamoring for her to kill the Chief. She staggers out of the hospital ward while the shadows drag the Chief back, and the memory collapses, plunging the Chief again through countless experiences of others' deaths. But as they fall, the mist obscuring the letters disappears as well.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nIn the depths of a mind, there is only void and darkness.</i></p>","interrogation3":"The girl awakens on the shore of DisSea in its modern, destroyed form. She tries to flee from the Corruptors around her, but even with her ailments having disappeared, she still is too weak, and falls. A shadow urges her, if she is really as desperate to live on as they are, to take them in and become their container. She witnesses one of the same deaths that the Chief did before, except she witnesses it from the perspective of NOX. She resists the shadows urging her to kill, but the shadows control her limbs and force her to take the boy's life.\r\n\r\nShe is left crying in the darkness until the Chief appears. With the power of the girl's real name, Amber, the shadows are dispelled. They protest that she can't fight DisSea alone and that they must stay together in order to live, but Amber asserts that NOX's existence is not living and takes the Chief's hand.\r\n\r\nThe Chief awakens in the real world and finds that, in spite of what appeared to be their victory in the illusion, NOX has gone manic, broken through her restraints, and escaped.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nNOX went manic and fled out of the blue</i></p>","interrogation4":"NOX crosses the [[[Broken Frontline]]] and enters the deepest part of DisSea. The Chief instructs Nightingale to tie a cable around them so they can be pulled back to safety, and then goes in after her. The Chief calls out to Amber, but when they find her, they see that there is no trace of her behind NOX's eyes.\r\n\r\nCorruptors swarm them, damaging the rescue cable. As the Chief's consciousness begins to succumb to the [[[Black Ring]]], Amber appears in front of them. She thanks the Chief for their help in reminder her what it meant to be human, but accepts that DisSea is her destined home. She apologizes that she can't protect them, but hopes that NOX will be able to instead.\r\n\r\nNox carries the Chief out of DisSea, back towards the Broken Frontline. The [[[Phantom Moon]]] of DisSea gives way to the sunrise that Amber was waiting to see, but NOX does not react.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nAmber disappeared.\nThe one left behind is NOX instead of Amber or the berserk shadow. It's just an empty shell that once protected you.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"Traces of the subject whereabouts were found in DisSea after the FAC and MBCC sent out a large number of staff. Due to the harsh environment and the subject's dangerous powers, conventional means of arrest was not sufficient to capture the subject, who was eventually taken back by the Chief.","arrestRec2":"There is no record of the subject's experience during the DisSea disaster. The information is destroyed in the explosion, and the MBCC is unable to investigate in the high-rish restricted area. The subject has blurry memory and is unable to perfectly recall the past. Further interrogation is to be needed after psychiatric treatment.","arrestRec3":"The subject used to suffer from mutation caused by aberrant crystal hyperplasia of the soft tissues, and was not able to move around freely. The subject spent 6 years living in a nursing home, \"Lakeside Home\", during which her will to live came from the rising sun under the Black Ring.","arrestRec4":"After the Black Ring's eruption, the subject wandered around in areas around DisSea for many years mentally unstable in an unconscious state. When wandering around the DisSea, the subject constantly shifted between the controlled and free mind, due to the strong desire to survive. The subjective consciousness of the subject seems to have no intention to harm humans.","servingTerm1":"Close to becoming a Corruptor, the subject has been given \"extra care\" by the FAC and quarantined with the highest defense standard. No normal humans are allowed to go near the room.","servingTerm2":"Curious about everything. Often asks the Chief to bring back all kinds of small appliances, game consoles, etc. and spends most of the time in the room playing with these objects to learn about modern society.","servingTerm3":"Rarely approaches people due to contamination, but does not resist friendly socialization with some Syndicate Sinners. Being born before the DisSea explosion, only Syndicate has traces of the life of that era the subject is familiar with.","servingTerm4":"Under the Chief's guarantee and supervision, the FAC finally treats NOX less harshly, and her cheerful personality gradually started to restore. But after a series of events, the humanity in her was completely gone.","emotionCheck1":"[NOX stares out the window.]\r\n\r\n**NOX:** I...

The erased memory of being a fighter doesn't rule out the potential threat of reverting to a cold-blooded killing machine.\n\n--\n\nThe interviews with several witnesses reveal that the subject's actions during the family restaurant incident were an act of self-defense after her and her family's lives were threatened. Her merciless way could be attributed to the nature of her prosthesis.\n\nIn the inspection following her detention, it's been found that her special power has granted her full compatibility with her prosthesis. With enough education, all violent behaviors in her can be effectively prevented.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThe power is not aggressive but is merely a perfect fit for artificial implants, which also allows the subject to perfectly manipulate the prosthesis and cold weapon armament.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nExperienced a direct Black Ring mutation and suffered a severe infection. The subject's power is suspected to be awakened when striving to survive the pollution. A rare Black Ring's survivor deserves further observation.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nThe original body was almost completely eroded, except for the brain, which was replaced by a robot. The state of physical mutation is unknown. The infection of the brain resulted in amnesia, but the current situation is stable. No recurrence or deterioration of amnesia has been detected.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Hello, Master Kitten.\"\n\"Would you like me to be your master?\"","arrestRec1":"When the Sinner squad carried out the mission in the Syndicate, Labyrinth was discovered hibernating in the morgue of the SALVA Hospital. After the successful awakening of the program, the subject joined the squad in the battle and joined the MBCC.","arrestRec2":"Has lost early memory and has no recollection of family situation or childhood. Judging from the subject's fighting performance, suspected to have been through strict fighter training.","arrestRec3":"The official researchers were unable to restore the subject's memory, who got sent back to the family restaurant to work as a waiter where the subject was first rescued. The subject's emotion fits perfectly with the mechanical nerves. The subject got along well with the people in the restaurant.","arrestRec4":"When the gang found out the whereabouts of the subject, several of them were sent to \"retrieve\" the subject. The family members of the restaurant staff was threatened by the gang members, which accidentally triggered the subject's fighting instinct.","servingTerm1":"Compared to fighting, the subject seems more interested in cleaning and tidying up. The prosthesis allows extremely high efficiency, which makes the cleaners become idle and get rebuked.","servingTerm2":"The maintenance workers noticed that the subject was unusually talkative when carrying out household chores. The language module was overloaded. Another file named \"Anti-amnesia diary\" over-occupied the system. Useless information of the subject's conversation with herself accounted for more than 80%. The subject is speculated to have an outgoing personality before pre-modification.","servingTerm3":"Temporarily loses the ability to carry out household chores and rational judgement in front of the researchers. Quickly switched to combat mode to protect herself from being dismantled and studied. Behaves normally otherwise. No complaints have been received from other Sinners against her, except for being too chatty.","servingTerm4":"Made multiple attempts to open the head prosthesis and invite the Chief to admire the last part of its original biological tissue—the brain, which continued despite repeated rejections. \"I want to show the Chief the human part of me to thank you for treating me as a human being.\"","emotionCheck1":"[Labyrinth is cleaning the Bureau and maintaining hygiene]\r\n\r\n**Labyrinth:** Chief, please don’t disrupt my work here.\r\n\r\n**Chief:** ......\r\n\r\n* **Prompt:** So you can communicate with me normally like everyone else.\r\n * **Labyrinth:** Combat form, activated.\r\n * **Labyrinth:** 😥😥\r\n\r\n* **Prompt:** I’d like a cup of tea, please.\r\n * **Labyrinth:** Roger that.

As a result, it was determined that she needed to be detained immediately.\n\n-- \n\nAfter a personal investigation by the Chief, it was determined that the Mania overflow incident happened because she was affected by Mania while under immense mental pressure from others.

She receives a phone call from herself, asking if she is there to destroy the phantom that caused the Ghost Call incidents. Eleven confirms that she is and that she wants to erase all memory of her show. The phantom tells her that as long as they both exist, there will always be another call at 3AM and that the world will always be full of things that Eleven would rather not hear. The line goes dead and Eleven begins to hallucinate a scene on the building's rooftop and the voices of her producers instructing her to pander harder to her audience.\n\nAt the MBCC, The Chief receives an alert of a Mania spike in Eastside. As they arrive at the TV Station, the phones of everybody in the street begin to ring. Eleven's voice says that she wants to resume her show and tells the Chief to come to the roof, where they find Eleven unconscious in a swirling mass of a Mania energy, holding an antique terminal with an active phone call. While the voice continues to talk through the call, the Chief Shackles Eleven. They are overcome by a wave of grief, but Eleven is shocked awake and uses her ability to destroy the terminal in her hand. She turns to the Chief and says that she has taken care of things now, and asks to be taken into custody. As they leave the station, a bulletin announces that Call at 3AM has been put on indefinite hiatus.\n\n//You met Eleven again at the TV station, where she as threatened by a power similar to hers. After resolving this threat, Eleven voluntarily returned to the Bureau with you for detention and interrogation.//","interrogation2":"Eleven is happy and cooperative in her interrogation, telling the Chief that she has wanted to come to the MBCC for some time now. Having negotiated the cancellation of her program, Eleven wiped the memories of the people who had been pulled into her spiritual realm, and now believes that she destroyed the source of the anomaly. However, the Chief shocks her with the news that after initially disappearing, rumors about Call at 3AM have begun a resurgence. Eleven explains that part of her power had split off from her, and that without it, she couldn't control her abilities. She intentionally drew the Chief to the Eastside TV Station, believing that together, they'd be able to destroy it. Eleven wants to seal the terminal away and is willing to give up her own powers if that means that it can never activate again, but the Chief persuades her to try using it one more time, believing that with the Shackles present, there is no danger and they might be able to learn some clues. Eleven begins to talk with something over the phone, and although she initially argues with it, she quickly begins to succumb to the voice telling her that her failures have all been due to her own weakness. The Chief tries to pull the terminal away from her, but they are pulled back into Eleven's inner world, very similar but much weaker to that which they had escaped from before. A passerby grabs their arm and obsessively instructs them that they have to get to work at the TV tower.\n\n//You brought back the old terminal from the TV station that used Eleven's and your power to call everyone. Eleven admitted that she couldn't control or destroy this part of the lost power. You and Eleven decided to use the terminal to activate the Shackles again in search of useful clues but unexpectedly created another world.//","interrogation3":"When the Chief enters the TV Station, the facial recognition system identifies them as Eleven and allows them access. They realize that the Shackles, combined with Eleven's power, have intertwined fragments of both their consciousnesses together into a single body. In Eleven's old workplace, they find a huge number of people working enthusiastically despite the late hour, and Eleven's boss pulls them in to record her radio show. Eleven instantly settles in to her rhythm, and the Chief observes that she seems to love what she does. Eleven reluctantly agrees, but the show begins and she is forced to focus on her work. The first caller is a nervous young woman whom Eleven is able to genuinely help, but the next call mocks the program and scorns her dedication. At the end of the show, Eleven's producer concocts a scheme for another employee to write scripts where she will pretend to be a bullied girl calling in to ask Eleven for advice. At the same time, she hands Eleven a new phone so that she can be available to be called in for work any time -- the same old terminal which housed the escaped part of her powers, and the Chief realizes that they are experiencing the origin of the ghost who caused the Ghost Calls incidents. As the Chief and Eleven take it, the world around them begins to crumble, and Eleven despairs that nothing has changed since the time when the ghost lived.\n\n//In the end, you discover that this world belongs to a part of the old terminal, coming from the Ghost in Ghost Call that has been troubling Eleven. She, just like Eleven, was a host. However, the good feelings she used to bring to others with her honesty and cheering personality were eventually turned into templates and lifeless performances aimed at getting views and earning profits.//","interrogation4":"Eleven’s mental state collapses and the world changes to the same rooftop where she met the Chief. Eleven begins to believe that she and the ghost are one and the same, having both had their genuine desire to help people betrayed and met only by cynicism and deception. She jumps from the roof, but the Chief catches her with the Shackles. They remind Eleven that despite everything, there are many people whom her show resonates with, and assert that if Eleven really wanted to erase Call at 3AM then it would have taken much more effort for the Chief to talk them down before.\n\nBack at the Bureau, [[[Nightingale]]] informs the Chief that Eleven has regained full use of her powers and that her M-Value is stable. She also reports that the higher-ups have approved Eleven’s request for one last radio gig. Eleven hosts a final going away episode of Call at 3AM, and when hecklers call in, she retorts fiercely rather than letting them trample over her. The Chief calls her and they discuss the things that Eleven loves about her job and how the new version of her can perform the work even better. Eleven signs off the show by thanking her listeners and promising that it’s not goodbye, but the beginning of a promise to come back some day.\n\n//Don’t be afraid of being crushed by darkness or sunk by falsehood. Since you chose to grow and evolve, use the power you gained from this to trample all that makes you suffer.//","arrestRec1":"After resolving the massive impact caused by the Mania overflow, she disappeared. However, investigations found that she might have resolved the root cause of the overflow incident. In the end, she voluntarily went to the Bureau and asked the Chief for detention.","arrestRec2":"The remnants of her Mania ability have once again generated a space distorted by the Mania power. After an interrogation with her, it is known that she has repeatedly investigated this Mania power and attempted to destroy it, but to no significant effect.","arrestRec3":"She and the Chief investigated the twisted space and found the truth about the original Call at 3 AM urban legend and her connection to it. With the efforts of her and the Chief, the urban legend was resolved, and the twisted space returned to normal.","arrestRec4":"At her request, the Eastside TV station's program Call at 3 AM will be permanently canceled, and Eleven will be removed from the TV station. However, the TV station allowed her to record a final farewell program. The farewell program was a departure from her usual style, with witty and aggressive commentary. As a result, it once again became a top search keyword and spawned a completely different late-night radio program specifically for the new her.","servingTerm1":"As a former late-night radio host, she initially had trouble adjusting to the Bureau's schedule, often staying awake at night. Given the nature of her unique voice, strange tales regarding \"voices\" soon started spreading around the Bureau.","servingTerm2":"She keeps a collection of peculiar items in her room, such as candy wrappers, Martian sand, and \"slimes.\" Investigations revealed that these were all tools for her ASMR recording sessions.","servingTerm3":"Most people in the Bureau enjoy engaging in heart-to-heart conversations with her. She even knows Hella's bank account balance and where Bai Yi's secret stash of alcohol is. Many also confide their negative feelings to her, and she rarely disappoints them. Through witty and incisive conversations, she helps them vent their frustrations.","servingTerm4":"She has an inexplicable obsession with Chief's working hours. If Chief works beyond the usual time, she will provide gentle reminders. However, most of the time, her reminders are of little use, and Chief often receives a call from her at 3 AM.","emotionCheck1":"[Eleven's dark circles under her eyes have become increasingly noticeable.]\n\n**Eleven:** Woken up again by the announcement for outdoor activity time...\n\n**Chief:** ......\n\n* **Prompt:** How about changing the program to daytime?\n * **Eleven:** But my heart is with those who need someone to confide in at night...\n * **Eleven:** 😥\n\n* **Prompt:** Try wearing earplugs while you sleep?\n * **Eleven:** I heard that the earplugs Miss [[[list of minor characters |Faye]]] purchased can \"block out all noises,\" yet the radio is capable of \"penetrating anything\"...

Your lion's roar is already very powerful, but if you use my vocal technique, it can definitely become even more intimidating.\n * **Chief:** Stop pranking her, Eleven, she'll really believe it.

I don't want to lose a door.\n * **Eleven:** Give me back my eyes! Give! It!

Even OwO can't pretend anymore, taking refuge directly behind you.\n * **Eleven:** I thought I heard people talking outside the door... What are you doing in the Training Room so late?\n * **Chief:** That's my line, Eleven. You're the reason behind the ghost story, practicing your vocal range in the middle of the night...\n * **Eleven:** Hehe, yes... This is a new vocal technique I've learned, it's said to make any voice scarier. Seems I've succeeded.\n * **Chief:** Yes, you certainly have, congratulations...

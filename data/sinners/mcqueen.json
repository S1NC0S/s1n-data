McQueen's studio engages in innumerable illicit dealings, and McQueen has cultivated quite a reputation for herself in the black market in recent years.\n\n--\n\nBesides her special power, the subject also possesses masterful art forgery skills. She has a more profound gift for art than regular art forgers, but she will never admit it. Compared to when she's interrogated by other staff, the subject definitely appears more cooperative and more willing to talk about herself when interacting with Chief.\n\nUnder the MBCC's strict supervision, the subject's art forgery business has entirely ceased since her detention.\n","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThe subject's power allows her to make replicas of objects. For her power to work, she needs to possess an adequate knowledge of the object she wishes to replicate. As a rule, McQueen can only replicate a work of art or herself, with the replica and the original being slightly different.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nThe subject awakened her power on account of the strong emotions she felt when she was betrayed and almost lost her life, an experience that left her both traumatized and disillusioned.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nThe subject suffers from a medium level of Maniac corruption. No visible abnormalities have been found on her body, but she is mentally unstable, troubled by occasional nightmares. The Maniac energies inside her seem to have magnified her dark side, leader her to destructive actions that defy comprehension.\r\n","ecbFlavourText":"\"How exactly have I come step by step to where I am today?\"\n\"Ha, it doesn't matter anymore... From now on, I am McQueen.\"","interrogation1":"Armed with [[[Lisa |Lisa's]]] testimony about their encounter during the [[[Sosia |Witching Hour]]], the [[[Chief]]] interrogates McQueen about her criminal history creating forgeries, allowing them to change hands a few times, and then reappearing as an art dealer to broker sales for her own fake paintings. They reveal that McQueen succeeded at making and selling copies of every work on display at Witching Hour, aside from Sosia.\n\nPretending to be telling a story about someone else, she tells the Chief about how, as a young painter still going by Jennie, struggling to make a name for herself, she was taken advantage of by an influential art dealer named McQueen. McQueen manipulated her into producing forgeries by promising to have her paintings displayed at Belphegor Art Museum. She eventually awakened as a [[[Sinner]]] and took revenge by murdering McQueen, adopting the woman's identity for herself. Learning that McQueen is adopting this persona which embodies everything she hates about Eastside, the Chief reminds her of her fears that appeared during the Witching Hour and urges her to set it aside and resume painting for herself.\n\nAt this, McQueen laughs and mocks the Chief for apparently not having discovered all of her illegal activities. She reveals that, like the McQueen before her, she is also coercing young artists to make forgeries for her; this despite the fact that her ability allows her to make them effortlessly herself. Embittered by her own past, McQueen now takes sadistic pleasure in participating in the ruination of the next generation, believing that this is a natural role in an art world that is rotten to the core. The Chief refuses to believe this, so McQueen offers them an invitation to find out for themself.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nMcQueen comes clean about her past and purposes, but denies that she still has a dream of art, as if she really enjoys her current state of lingering about the edge of chaos.\nIs the reality as bad as she describes? Perhaps you'll find an answer in this invitation.</i></p>","interrogation2":"McQueen is the auctioneer at a charity event in Eastside. She begins the auction by offering two covered paintings; unveiling the first, she reveals a painting called //The Rising Sun// by an unknown artist, which is impressive to the Chief, but too amateurish to impress the crowd, especially at the exorbitant 1 million DisCoin rate where she begins the bidding. She fabricates a story about the painting being from [[[DisSea]]], which garners some interest, but still not enough for the stated price. McQueen then reveals the second painting, which is an exact replica of //The Rising Sun// made by a once-beloved, now retired, artist named [[[List of Minor Characters |Maureen]]]. The crowd is willing to bid on the forgery, and the Chief believes that this was the point McQueen wanted to make: that the art buyers don't care about the content of the art, only the name attached.\n\nHowever, McQueen goes further, and plays a shell game with the two identical paintings, then destroys one of them with her knife. With nobody now knowing whether the surviving painting is the one by an unknown artist or the one by Maureen, McQueen resumes the bidding: now at 30 million DisCoins. To the Chief's shock, the crowd goes wild and the price quickly rises. Feeling McQueen's [[[Mania |M-Value]]] rising, they begin to put an end to the display, but are stopped by Maureen herself, who is in the audience, who says that she made the forgery of her own accord, not coerced by McQueen, because she wanted to be a popular artist and live luxuriously again.\n\nAs the price continues to rise, McQueen suddenly sets fire to the remaining painting. She says that a beautiful thing is fragile and can be lost, but tragedy is the ultimate art that will never die. She then re-offers the burning painting, now taking bids at 300 million DisCoins.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nThe painters who break their own wings for fame and wealth. The buyers who lose their sanity for elusive lies... McQueen has successfully proved the absurdity of Eastside's art circle, but she doesn't seem to want to stop there.\nThe maniacal farce is still going on. </i></p>","interrogation3":"The auction goes wild, with fights breaking out between bidders and some in the crowd attempting to rush the stage to grab pieces of the ruined paintings. Trying to prevent the Mania levels in the hall from rising further, the Chief attempts to stop McQueen, but is again prevented by Maureen, who begs them to let it be. The Chief attempts to convince her that what's really on auction is her dignity and reputation, and she allows them to approach the podium.\n\nMcQueen tells the Chief that there is nothing wrong with selling out when the alternative is having one's dreams crushed by cruel reality. The Chief refutes them, saying that there is always the chance to change the future regardless of any regrets one may have. Since McQueen can't let go of her traumatic past, the Chief says that they will help her be rid of it, and finishes burning the remains of //The Rising Sun//. McQueen is awed, and then overjoyed at the Chief's actions in denying the crowd their fun and forcing them to go home empty handed.\n\nThe enraged crowd attacks them, and the Chief and McQueen flee while Maureen holds back the pursuit, and the two are rescued by MBCC reinforcements. On the way back to the Bureau, McQueen agrees to stop seducing new artists into the same destructive pattern that destroyed her, because one way or another, she is under the Chief's control. McQueen still believes that anybody who is able to put the past behind them and turn over a new leaf is an exception, not proof that the world is any less rotten than she believes -- but she wishes that rather than having met the real McQueen all those years ago, Jennie would have met someone like the Chief or [[[Lisa]]], and wonders how different her life would have been.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nMcQueen has promptly agreed not to lure other painters into giving up their dreams again, but later investigations show that her firm in Eastside has not completely ceased its operations.\nThe last sentence she said when she left the interrogation room seems to have already explained her later decisions.\nVain, chaotic, and fickle... That is the real McQueen. That is how Eastside's high society functions. </i></p>","arrestRec1":"The subject crosses paths with MBCC Sinners during the Witching Hour Exhibition in the Belphegor Art Museum. She escapes when it's discovered that she's a Sinner trying to make replicas. As soon as the exhibition ends, the MBCC carries out a search and arrests McQueen; the MBCC is also able to gather evidence of McQueen making forgeries.","arrestRec2":"The subject, who used to go by the name of Jennie, was an art student at a college of art in Eastside. During her school years, she stayed on the straight and narrow and had a great passion for art. But the collectors in the profession doubted her talents and potential as an artist, despite complimenting her on her efforts.","arrestRec3":"The negative reviews sent her down a spiral of depression. It was when she was at rock bottom that she met an art dealer called McQueen in an art gallery and was unknowingly led onto the path of art forgery by the art dealer's lies and deception. When she found out, she had a falling-out with the art dealer, awakening her power in the process, which directly led to the death of the art dealer.","arrestRec4":"This experience left Jennie disillusioned about the entire art scene. She abandoned her old name and gave up her career as an artist, going deeper into the forgery market as an art dealer under the new name McQueen. Ever since then, she has been making forgeries that are passed off as genuine, in an effort to get back at the Eastside art world that has failed her.","servingTerm1":"McQueen keeps in her room a few Klein blue ornaments and decorations, which she takes great care to wipe immaculately clean. When she notices that many MBCC staffers and Sinners show interest in them, she insists that they come over to take a look and asks to them guess if a particular item is fake or genuine. And as it turns out, all of her collectibles are fake.","servingTerm2":"Every time McQueen goes to Eastside for a mission, she almost always encounters someone she knows, from upper-class customers to black market brokers. Man or woman, young or old, they all have a good rapport with McQueen. On a few occasions, McQueen even managed to quickly sell one forgery or two to a passerby when the MBCC's staffers' backs were turned.","servingTerm3":"McQueen is easy-going, stylish, attractive, and a people person through and through. Her popularity within the MBCC is climbing into the stratosphere. This pleases her so much that she creates several clones of herself to cater to a growing fan base.","servingTerm4":"McQueen insists on using such saccharine terms of endearment as //Darling//, //Baby//, and //Beauty// to address the Chief, and tries out such acts as head-touching and Kabedon on the Chief time and again. These tricks don't work on the Chief, but that doesn't discourage her in the slightest.","emotionCheck1":"[McQueen is facing an astronomical fine for an art scheme]\r\n\r\n**McQueen:** Don't worry.

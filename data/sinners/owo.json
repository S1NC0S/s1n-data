OwO is set on keeping alive the family tradition of lion dancing, but due to her young age and the obscurity of the art form, she was virtually unknown outside of Drifter Camp. It's not until the release of her blockbuster that she started attracting public attention.\n\n--\n\nInvestigation reveals that the subject's power awakened due to her instinct to protect a stranger in an emergency situation. She is in fact kind and innocent, highly resistant to contamination, and mentally stable. She often got into a series of accidents and disputes due to her ignorance about Sinners and the related regulations. Under the Bureau's education and monitoring, there have been no similar occurrences since.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nEvil spirits and vicious enemies, the majestic lion keeps out. Good fortune and bountiful blessings, the glorious lion brings in.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nAfter the DisCars Incident, OwO volunteered to escort Stella the Starbeast back to its hometown. But before they arrived, they were attacked by unidentified monsters, and OwO, seized by an overwhelming desire to protect Stella, awakened her power.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nA battery of medical examinations has been conducted on OwO. The results show that she is in good mental health; as it turns out, not only does OwO have a knack for the lion dance, but she also has a knack for resisting Maniac corruption.","ecbFlavourText":"Auspiciousness will drive away bad luck and protect you from catastrophe!","interrogation1":"Since the end of the DisCars, the Chief has received postcards from OwO detailing her journeys in search of her hometown. Eventually, OwO writes that she has found Goldionville and will be returning to show the Chief what she’s learned. A short time later, the Chief responds to an alert of a Sinner causing a disturbance in [[[Syndicate]]]. It turns out to be OwO, using her ability to cause chaos in a public street as she accuses the residents of having stolen her lion head. When the Chief approaches, OwO recognizes them as the little clapper, and orders them and their guards to make the people return her head, but the Chief solemnly places her under arrest.\n\nIn the MBCC, the Chief interrogates OwO about what she’s been doing since her departure and how her power has grown so greatly in so little time. Under the guise of trying to gather information in order to find the lion head, OwO explains that she encountered a caravan from [[[Eirene |Quinn]]], which had traded with Goldionville and recognized her head as being from that town. OwO defended the caravan from attackers, and her description of the battle makes the Chief realize that OwO possesses power from Stella the Apostle of Ash as well as her own Sinner power.\n\nOwO’s story concludes with admitting that upon her return to DisCity, the lion head simply disappeared in Syndicate while she wasn’t looking. OwO storms out of the interrogation room, intent on finding it and with the Chief reluctantly in tow.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nYou learn from the interrogation that while searching for Goldionville, OwO saved one of Quinn's caravans. The caravan happened to have traded with Goldionville, so to thank her, they took OwO to Goldionville.\nBesides, OwO got her lion head stolen soon after she returned to Syndicate. To calm her down, you decide to go back to Syndicate with her to look for the lost lion head.</i></p>","interrogation2":"OwO and the Chief return to Syndicate and continue questioning the locals about the Lion head’s disappearance. In exchange for a bribe, which confuses OwO, a man directs them towards an alley occupied by an urchin boy who has a reputation as a thief. There they find the boy amateurishly dancing with the lion head, attempting to mimic OwO's dance from her movie. Upon finishing the dance, he calls OwO a liar, because the lion dance didn't bring him home like OwO said it does in the film. The children argue, and OwO is flummoxed by the rare appearance of someone louder and more stubborn than she is. With no other recourse, OwO decides that she will help the orphaned boy find his lost home.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nYou followed the clue from a homeless man and found the boy who stole the lion head in an alley. He imitated OwO's moves in the movie and danced with the lion head, but failed to gain the power to return home. To prove that the lion head can indeed bring people power, OwO again assigns you a new mission: help the boy find his home with her. </i></p>","interrogation3":"The boy, whose name is Bagley, says that his parents snuck him onto a caravan heading to DisCity when he was a baby, and that his only recollection of his home is of purple flowers in the desert. The Chief takes Bagley and OwO on a road trip through the area southeast of DisCity where the caravan traveled through, while the children continue to bicker in the backseat. OwO, as always, boasts about the magnificence of Goldionville's culture, prompting Bagley to ask why she returned to DisCity if Goldionville is so great. OwO is unable to answer, but their argument is interrupted when the Chief spots the purple flowers Bagley had described up ahead. However, when the trio exits their vehicle, they discover that the surrounding town is ruined and abandoned.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nOn the way, OwO shares with Bagley how she gained the lion head's power, her hometown's culture, and the lion head eye-dotting tradition.\nBagley is very envious of her. He asks her why she's returning to DisCity if she finds her hometown so amazing. OwO seems baffled by the question.\nMeanwhile, Bagley finds a tiny flower from his home on the roadside. </i></p>","interrogation4":"Bagley grieves for the loss of his hometown, while OwO tries childishly to comfort him. Unsuccessful in her attempts, OwO asks the Chief to step in; they agree, but say that OwO should be the one to help Bagley, since he is her friend. OwO repeats the story that the Chief tells her about the town, telling Bagley that it was called Pearlie and was known for the purple dye that it made from the flowers in his memories. That dye has since been exported to DisCity and from there to the rest of the world, meaning that a part of Pearlie's culture lives on everywhere just like Goldionville's does through OwO's lion's dance. OwO realizes that the reason she wanted to come back even after finding Goldionville was because even though her roots were far away, all the people she knows and loves are in DisCity. They return to the city, with both children excited to keep the traditions of their hometowns alive.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nEncouraged by OwO, Bagley understands that the pearly flower, named after his village, still exists in many parts of DisCity as an essential ingredient of a dye. Even though his home is no more, this flower still blooms everywhere, carrying his village's hope, culture, and memories.\nAs she consoles Bagley, OwO also finds the answer to the earlier question. She's always been carrying her hometown's culture with her, so she's never truly left home. Now, she returns to DisCity because her friends and loved ones are here. </i></p>","arrestRec1":"Chief made the acquaintance of OwO in the Blockbuster Films Incident and helped her with filmmaking. After the incident was resolved, OwO embarked on a journey to find her hometown, while her whereabouts and the situation she was in were being monitored by an MBCC agent.","arrestRec2":"OwO's parents joined the Goldionville Caravan as a way to better their situation. The family of three traveled with the caravan to DisCity. Later on, OwO's parents, convinced that DisCity would be a better place for OwO to grow up in, entrusted her to a trustworthy fellow clansman from Drifter Camp, where she was adored and pampered by the locals. Because of her upbringing, she has become a wilful character who throws tantrums when things don't go her way and who never hides her pleasure when compliments come her way.","arrestRec3":"Following in her parents' footsteps, OwO took up lion dancing, and she has an all-consuming love of the art form. OwO has a giant lion head that she carries with her at all times. According to OwO herself, she and her parents once found themselves in grave peril on their way to DisCity, and she escaped unhurt by, at her parents' urge, hiding inside the lion head. So to her, it is more than just a symbol of good luck; it's a holy object that has protected her and her loved ones all this way.","arrestRec4":"OwO grew up in DisCity, but under the influence of her family, she wholeheartedly adopted the customs of her distant hometown. She felt like a misfit growing up, and loneliness was a constant companion. That's how the idea of one day returning to her hometown to reunite with her clansmen was planted.","servingTerm1":"OwO is insolent and willful, but it's hard not to have affection for her. She became one of the most popular figures in the MBCC almost instantly, sneaking her way into the hearts of many Sinners and staffers.","servingTerm2":"OwO is a big fan of Movie Night, an event organized by the MBCC in the recreation area on a regular basis. She never misses a movie, and nothing makes her tick like old-time kung fu movies. When caught up in the moment, she'll jump up and start swinging her arms and kicking her legs.","servingTerm3":"OwO and Dudu are close; they reportedly come from the same place, and that's why they have so much to say to each other. OwO once did a lion dance accompanied by Dudu on Suona, but the effect left much to be desired.","servingTerm4":"At first, OwO's unruliness was a real headache for Chief. But after spending time with her, Chief has figured out a way to deal with her.

Deals 5% more Damage, and another 5% more for enemies with broken Cores.","maniaIntensifyTitle":"Fierce","maniaIntensifyText":"CRIT Rate is increased by 10%.","criminalRecord":"Abused special power when putting out a fire. The high-pressure water flow affected the civilian vehicles and fire trucks parked nearby, resulting in a certain amount of property damage. Though no casualties resulted, the subject's Sinner identity negatively impacted the public image of the fire department and thus the subject needs to be immediately suspended from work and detained.\n\n--\n\nHer profile shows that she had maintained good attendance at work and showed no abnormal signs up until the great fire of Eastside. It's therefore believed that the fire awakened her special power. Since her detention, it's been found that the subject has poor control over her power and she wishes to improve. The Bureau has thus built a special facility for her to store equipment and practice controlling her power. The subject's presence has eliminated fire prevention pitfalls within the Bureau and has been beneficial to all other Sinners' safety.\n","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nAble to produce high-pressure water flow out of thin air which has an ultra-long-range linear course, only the release must rely on a medium. The subject is permitted to keep the reinforced fire hose supplied by the fire department to aid in battles.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nThe subject's ability awakened amidst a severe fire in Eastside due to the subject's strong will to save the victims. The first release of their power was too demanding that the subject was unable to cease it in time after the fire was put out, resulting in damage.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nShows a fairly low degree of mutation and infection. Having had professional firefighter training, the subject's physical ability is far higher than that of the average woman of the same age. No corruption symptoms have been detected.","ecbFlavourText":"\"I'm not some charity ambassador! I don't want to be just a pretty face!\"\n\"I am... Flora, a firefighter of the Eastside Fire Department! I can fight too!\"\n","arrestRec1":"Upon receiving a report from the Eastside Fire Department that a firefighter awakened on duty amid a severe fire in Eastside, staff were immediately sent out to arrest the subject. Still comprehending the situation during the arrest, the subject appeared dazed and did not resist.","arrestRec2":"The subject's father was a firefighter of the Eastside Fire Department who has saved countless lives and was generally revered through the field. He retired after suffering severe injuries during an assignment and now runs a grocery store with his wife. He often recounts his heroic stories to his daughter and had a deep influence on Flora in her childhood.","arrestRec3":"The only female firefighter in Eastside who joined the Eastside Fire Department with her father's recommendation and despite her mother's objection. However, the subject was never able to operate firefighting tools smoothly. Dismissed for being a woman and for being recommended by her own father, she never got to serve on the front line and was put to handle fire safety promotion work.","arrestRec4":"When the fire broke out in Eastside, all the firefighters in the city were summoned except for Flora. She was even made to leave, being told that she would hinder the firefighting process as a mere promotion officer. But the fire brigade was unable to put out the fire effectively, and the fire would have gone totally out of control if it hadn't been for the subject's awakening.","servingTerm1":"Still keeping the old habit from the fire department, the subject's detention room is simply decorated. Besides essential everyday products, the subject only keeps a childhood photo with her father and the user manuals of every machine in the Bureau. Despite that, the subject still tends to break machines due to improper operation.","servingTerm2":"Insisted on reading aloud the 100 fire safety tips every morning through the Bureau's PA system for a while. After the staff installed a fingerprint lock for the PA room, the unique morning alarm finally ceased. But everyone has already been brainwashed by the subject's announcement, and it actually has served the purpose of hazard prevention during a few critical moments.","servingTerm3":"Demonstrates normal social behavior and gets along well with Sinners and staff. But when faced with Sinners with fire abilities, the subject will suddenly become extra paranoid and may even do absurd things such as stalking those Sinners. The subject has received several warnings due to such suspicious behaviors.","servingTerm4":"Based on the layout of Chief's office, the subject has redesigned the fire escape routes and listed out all the safe spots in the office that can provide cover. Chief's Fire Safety Manual contains 99 pages in which all the text and illustrations were written and drawn by hand by Flora.","emotionCheck1":"[Flora holds a notebook and starts asking you questions.]\r\n\r\n**Flora:** You remember that you have to do a regular check on the fire-fighting equipment today, right?\r\n\r\n**Chief:** ……\r\n\r\n* **Prompt:** I’ve checked all 43 locations for fire protection\r\n * **Flora:** Well, that's more like it.

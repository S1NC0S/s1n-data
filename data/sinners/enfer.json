She comes from an artistic family, with both her parents being renowned artists. At first, her artistic style was not recognized in the mainstream, and she could only show her creations on a small scale. Her creations, according to herself, are representations of the world she sees.\nThe Witching Hour Incident, brought about by Enfer's power, has caused serious damage and painful repercussions in Eastside, she must be detained immediately.\n\n-\n\nAccording to Chief, the subject activated her power during the Witching Hour incident due to her own agony and her biased view of the world. Despite that, Chief still believes the subject has a good side, which Chief attempts to uncover and nurture. Though the outcome is still unknown, the subject is now stable and has warmed up to Chief. Her prognosis is rather promising.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThe subject's power allows her to manipulate the mental images of her victims. By making them see images or objects that frighten them, she breaks them physically and psychologically.\r\n\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nIt's initially inferred that Enfer awakened her power after witnessing the death of her loved ones and being directly exposed to the [[[BR-004]]] on the day of its appearance. But upon further investigation, the MBCC believes that this might not be the day on which Enfer awakened her power, and it might have happened at an early date.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nCrystals are obvious on Enfer's body; Enfer has chiseled them into the shape of a heart. Though it's not easy to discern, her mental state is not very stable.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Humans are monsters constructed of lies and falsehood.\"\n\"I'm only carving out their real faces.\"","interrogation1":"A week after the Witching Hour's end, Enfer awakens, having become an S-Class Sinner. In the meantime, the source of the Witching Hour's power has remained a mystery. The Chief questions her about it, and Enfer says that she has always yearned for fear, and given up on love long ago, believing that it is fragile, fake, and defenseless. Fear, in contrast, is all that keeps people alive. However, she recalls [[[Sosia |Sosia's]]] words to her, that Enfer's fear was not pure and that she had never truly abandoned love. Enfer wonders what she was feeling when she became a Sinner, and what is the origin of her power. The Chief promises to stay by her as she tries to figure it out, and she suggests that they go together back to the Belphegor Art Museum.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Enfer, too, knows little about the Witching Hour's power, but you both are certain it is related to Sinner power.\nEnfer wants you to visit Belphegor with her again for an investigation.</i></p>","interrogation2":"The chamber where Sosia once stood is filled with shattered fragments of Enfer's works. She sadly picks through the rubble, and uses the pieces to re-create a small sculpture of a cocoon with a tiny heart-shaped mark, but it shatters at the smallest touch. Enfer compares an artist's lifecycle to that of a moth: struggling, growing, starting over, and eventually evolving to a complete form, impressing everyone, and then plunging into fire and leaving the world with only their residue. She says that she wants to create a perfect mark that can never be forgotten.\n\nWhile cleaning up the rubble, the Chief notices that the rest of Enfer's works have the same heart-shaped mark as the cocoon. But they find an oil painting without the mark, made by Enfer when she was young, before her mother's disappearance; her mother was an oil painter, and Enfer rarely painted again after her death. The Chief asks her about it, and Enfer confusedly says that she is not conscious of marking her art this way. It reminds them of Sosia's claim that there is something Enfer is unwilling to let go of. In order to hunt for the origin of this mark, Enfer brings the Chief back to her home.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Enfer re-creates a small sculpture with the fragments of her works. You find on the sculpture a tiny heart-shaped mark, just like the one present on most of Enfer's works.\nBut that mark is missing on a painting in the art museum painted by Enfer when she was little...\nEnfer seems to recall something and hopes that you can accompany her back to her home.</i></p>","interrogation3":"Inside her and her father's studio, Enfer tells the true story of her parents: their marriage was arranged, to combine their artistic genes in their daughter. Her mother tried to love her father, but the truth behind her disappearance is that she was killed by him to create inspiration for his famous sculpture, The Truthful One. Witnessing this is what shaped Enfer's philosophy on love and fear. On the day that BR-004 appeared, he also tried to make Enfer into a sacrifice for his art, but she killed him instead, sealing her fear of him into The False One, the sculpture that made her famous.\n\nEnfer shows The False One to the Chief, who is shocked to recognize it as the illusion that emerged from the Gate of Hell to defeat Sosia during the Witching Hour. Enfer is in disbelief at this revelation, believing that she had conquered this fear and that it should have held no power over her. Examining the sculpture, she sees that it too bears the heart-shaped mark. The Chief attempts to calm her, but her power fluctuates out of control and The False One comes to life. It devours Enfer and the world is overtaken by darkness.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Not all of Enfer's artworks are destroyed. Her masterpiece, which has brought her fame, is still kept in the studio. It's her awakening of fear, as well as fear's restraint on her.\nWhen Enfer discovers the heart-shaped mark on the sculpture, the unstable power leaks again, allowing the sculpture to... devour Enfer using its remaining power.</i></p>","interrogation4":"In her spiritual realm, Enfer and the Chief watch memories of her past fears, from childish scares to her mother's murder. In the memory, the Chief recognizes Enfer's mother as the spirit who appeared to protect her at the end of the Witching Hour. They realize that her mother's love has been branded in her unconscious ever since that day. The False One appears again and says that this love is what holds her back; only by forgetting her mother can Enfer embrace pure fear and create a perfect work of art. It devours her again, but Enfer seizes control of her spiritual realm and breaks free, refuting the sculpture's words by saying that she named it \"The False One\" because everything her father believed in was his own delusion. The pain of losing her mother and fear that she held toward her father for that act cast her into hell, but she realizes that it is because of love that she has been able to survive in hell. As the ruler of fear, she will not fear love, but rather let it become part of her power. The heart-shaped mark appears and with her chisel and the help of the shackles, she breaks through, emerging into the real world like a blue moth escaping from a black cocoon.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Love is her redemption and her curse. But above all, it is her power.\nLove allows her to walk with fear and embrace the blazing flames.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"In the Witching Hour Incident, the Chief gets through the maze built by Enfer the Witch and rescues her. After that, Enfer goes to the MBCC with the Chief of her own volition, and agrees to be detained.","arrestRec2":"Coming from an artistic background, Enfer is one of the top sculptors in Eastside. She sees her creations as an extension of herself. In the Witching Hour Incident, her power increased drastically, and she is now an S-class Sinner. She is adjusting to her new role, learning to see the world through a new pair of lenses.","arrestRec3":"Enfer's mother was a much bigger name than Enfer's father in the art world. Out of jealousy and driven to madness by stress, Enfer's father eventually killed his wife to create the sculpture //The Truthful One//. This incident influences Enfer's early works, and is the inspiration behind Enfer's series of horror-themed sculptures.","arrestRec4":"On the night The Truthful One was created, Enfer was saved by her mother from her father's sculpting knife. She has been haunted by the memory since. This memory has driven her to explore the nature of horror, but what her mother did for her that night has also set the tone for her later creations—love is a theme that she'll turn to in the future.","servingTerm1":"In the early days of her detention, Enfer is prideful and unsociable. She keeps to herself, spending her free time largely in her room or the reading room, instead of socializing or talking with others.","servingTerm2":"Enfer sometimes discusses art with other Sinners interested in it, like Lisa, who once praised Enfer's unique style.","servingTerm3":"Apart from sculpture and oil painting, Enfer seems to show a keen interest in Kinbaku. She is often found standing in front of a sculpture with a length of rope in her hands, and she sometimes seeks out Sinner Macchiato to ask questions about the subject.","servingTerm4":"It seems that Enfer has a special attachment to Chief. She makes a sculpture for Chief. It is a sculpture that conveys a sense of warmth and beauty; this is a huge departure from her usual style, which is steeped in morbidity and horror.","emotionCheck1":"[Enfer looks a bit troubled.]\r\n\r\n**Enfer:** The new stones ordered for sculpture creation did not seem right\r\n\r\n**Chief:** ......\r\n\r\n* **Prompt:** I had the Supply Office reorder some materials.\r\n * **Enfer:** Hmm, thanks.

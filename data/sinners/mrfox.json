He clarifies to the Chief in the interrogation room that two days before he was arrested, he took on a job from a new client and wishes to be present in court. The Chief details the circumstances of his arrest: while acting as defendant for the suspect of a serial murder case, he was confirmed to have not only bribed witnesses, but to have used his Sinner ability in order to sway the ruling in his client's favor. Fox defends his actions, saying that as his client's idea of \"justice\" was to be seen as innocent, he was only doing his duty as a lawyer to see it realized. The Chief then asks if Fox intends to do the same in his upcoming case, in which a maid with no motive is being tried for poisoning her Eastside employer. He confirms that he will. Upon hearing this, the Chief denies his application.\n\nNot wanting to ruin his 100% success rate, Fox attempts to use his ability on the Chief to force them to sign. This causes him immense pain to the point of bleeding. Seemingly under Fox's spell, the Chief does so, and Fox leaves the interrogation room in a haggard state. Shortly after, Nightingale asks the Chief why they complied despite being protected from his influence by the Shackles. The Chief reveals that they intend to beat Fox at his own game, using this upcoming case as a trap to ensure he stays behind bars.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Given his unconventional interpretation of \"justice\", you believe Mr. Fox should not be permitted to leave.\nWith his power, Mr. Fox forces you to allow him. You decide to play along and try to reverse his mind.</i></p>","interrogation2":"Posing as a special representative from the City Council, the Chief enters the mansion of the Golstoy family. They meet Mrs. Golstoy in the foyer, who is insistent that the maid, Rita, is the culprit, and is confident that she and Fox will win the case. Arriving at the dining room, the real scene of the crime, they meet some resistance from local law enforcement, but are ultimately able to conduct the necessary investigations, finding several traces of foul play as well as of the late Mr. Golstoy's sexual escapades. During the search, they find a family portrait, showing Mr. Golstoy with another woman and a boy. One of the officers explains that the child, Golstoy Jr, suffers from an unknown mental disability, and that after his birth, Mr. Golstoy went through marriage after marriage in order to produce a more \"suitable\" heir. The Chief then requests to speak with Rita. The officers inform them that she has been under house arrest in her quarters down the hall.\n\nRita's room is prison-like, with no outward facing windows, only a small opening in the door through which she and the Chief converse. She confesses to allowing Mr. Golstoy to take his medication with alcohol due to the severity of his condition, but given that that was not the cause of death, she is uncertain what could have been — she was responsible for all of his food and drink. She shares that she dislikes the \"new\" Mrs. Golstoy, and shortly after, Golstoy Jr. arrives in the home. He speaks in broken sentences, implying that someone abused him and allowed a rat to bite his finger, as well as vouching for Rita's integrity. Having heard enough, the Chief leaves, only to see Fox's car pull up outside. Fox states that due to using his power on the Chief, he will be unable to use it again until after the case is done, expressing a desire that their playing field be level when they meet in court.\n\nOn the day of the trial, the proceedings begin to go as expected. Rita's defense attorney is lackluster, and Fox has clearly exerted some amount of influence over the witness he calls to the stand. Before the verdict is announced, Chief speaks up from the audience, determined to administer true justice.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The information you received from the manor's mistress, maid and young master concerns you.\nFox is no longer eligible to use his ability. You and he are going to have a fair duel that he wishes for.</i></p>","interrogation3":"The Chief's first piece of evidence is a bag of a white grain-like substance found at the scene. Analysis confirmed it to be Mr. Golstoy's medication, stored suspiciously next to the sugar, something that only Mrs. Golstoy could have had the authority to do. Given the timeline of when Mr. Golstoy began taking it in relation to his death, the Chief poses that his death was the result of chronic toxicity, not acute toxicity from a sudden overdose. Their second piece of evidence is another lab analysis, but this time, of lubricant found in the kitchen carpet, mixed with the medication as well as Mr. Golstoy's bodily fluids, suggesting that Mrs. Golstoy managed to somehow administer it during sex. When prompted by Fox as to her motive, the Chief suggests that given Mr. Golstoy's reputation, Mrs. Golstoy feared the abandonment that might result from the ailing man's impotency, ultimately deciding that it would be easier to manipulate his son instead. Fox applauds the novel deduction, but reveals that it was all for naught: Mrs. Golstoy is currently not written into any will nor inheritance.\n\nFox then turns the court's attention once more to Rita, suggesting that given her closeness to Golstoy Jr., she is not free of suspicion. Rita finally speaks up, saying she will accept blame for the crime as long as Golstoy Jr. suffers no more abuse at the hands of his stepmother. Fox listens intently as she explains that Mr. Golstoy also abused his son, treating him as less than human due to his disability. The Chief then calls Golstoy Jr. to the stand, who corroborates this once more, insisting that Mrs. Golstoy \"let the rat bite him.\" As Mrs. Golstoy lashes out, Mr. Fox recalls a scene from his past. He decides then to side with the Chief, who explains that the \"rat\" was Mr. Golstoy's cigar cutter, a gray metal object with a long leather string, calling for the young man to show off his injuries. Fox condemns Mrs. Golstoy's actions, and the trial comes to a close.\n\nBack at the Golstoy manor, Rita expresses her joy at the result of the case. However, she then reveals that she had actually begun to lace Golstoy Jr.'s drink with the drug. Her body starts to mutate, and as she lunges for Golstoy Jr, the Chief and Mr. Fox intervene to save him, ending with Fox using his ability to force the Manic Rita to commit suicide. Exhausted, he asks the Chief if they knew Rita was infected with Mania, and the Chief replies that she was the real reason they got involved with the trial. Fox elaborates on his past with child abuse, how his actions in court inadvertently caused a young boy's suicide. Due to his survivor's guilt, he approaches \"justice\" the way he does as a means of self-flagellation, in hopes that it will make his \"final punishment\" more severe. He tells the Chief that he hopes they will be the one to mete out his judgment.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Those who hurt other people eventually get what's coming for them.\nBut what people think to be justice isn't always true justice.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"In a case involving Sinners, Mr. Fox used his powers to make a witness change testimony on the court, and thus his Sinner identity is revealed.

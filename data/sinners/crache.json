Do it!\"","interrogation1":"Over the course of a month sometime between the defeat of [[[BR-004]]] and the [[[Rustfire]]] Rebellion, the Chief investigates a lead regarding the last known [[[mania |Mania Crystals]]] in Syndicate. They are believed to be in the possession of [[[syndicate |Thou Voodoos]]], but by the time their hideout is raided by the MBCC, the crystals are gone. Thou Voodoo prisoners claim that they were stolen by the Homeless.\n\nThe Chief interrogates Crache to learn more. She initially denies having any connection to the Homeless, much less being their leader. However, when the Chief tells her that the Homeless are suspected to have stolen the stockpile of Mania Crystals, Crache is shocked into dropping the act. She doesn't want to believe that they would do such a thing, but as the Chief lays out the facts of the case, Crache becomes increasingly unable to deny the possibility. Still, she is coldly furious that the Chief only shows interest in the Homeless when they get tied up in an issue like the Mania Crystals, and never before when they were suffering and dying in Syndicate. But despite her anger and distrust of authority, Crache's concern for the danger that the Homeless faces from the crystals forces her to cooperate with the Chief.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nYou confirmed through the interrogation that Crache was unaware of the stolen Mania Crystals, and therefore thought of another possibility: someone else within //the Homeless// had organized the event.\nOut of concern for her partners, Crache agreed to your invitation to cooperate in the investigation.</i></p>","interrogation2":"In the streets of Syndicate, the Chief and Crache save a boy from gangsters who accuses him and his friends of having stolen from them. The boy leads them back to the playground that serves as the Homeless's base, where the many children there are instinctively wary of the Chief, but overjoyed to see Crache, whom everybody has missed since she disappeared into MBCC custody. With Crache's permission, the Chief questions the rescued boy about the Mania Crystals. Few of the kids have heard of them, but they recognize the Chief's description and divulge that Sandy, the Homeless's deputy chief, stole some of them. Neither she nor several other members have been seen since. The news enrages Crache, and she disappears into the shadows to search Syndicate for the missing Homeless.\n\nCrache finds Sandy hiding from a pack of Thou Voodoos, and dispatches her pursuers. Although Sandy is delighted to see Crache, Crache questions her coldly about the Crystals. Sandy admits that she stole something from Thou Voodoos and says that she sold it for enough money that she could protect the Homeless without Crache around, but she denies that they were Mania Crystals. She also claims that the other missing members are just hiding out to avoid their hunters. The Chief arrives, having tracked Crache via the [[[Shackles]]]. Crache tells them to stay away from her, but Sandy interjects and says that while she didn't steal the Mania Crystals, she knows who did; she offers to give the Chief that information in exchange for protection. Though hesitant, Crache decides to trust her friend and accepts their deal.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nAfter talking to the kids, you have found out that some of them know a lot about Mania Crystals, and that a member of the //the Homeless// named Sandy has been missing for days and may be the real organizer of the theft.\nHowever, when you find Sandy, she insists that she is not the person who stole Mania Crystals and is willing to help you find them in exchange for asylum.</i></p>","interrogation3":"That night, while the two girls stay together at the Bureau, Crache angrily questions Sandy about the truth behind the Mania Crystals. Sandy assures her that she would never lie, and Crache apologizes, explaining that she's just worried for Sandy's safety and all the other Homeless. Sandy admits that when Crache disappeared, she thought about stealing the crystals so that she could become a Sinner and protect the Homeless in Crache's stead, but chickened out before actually touching them. They make a plan to bring the Chief to Thou Voodoos hideout so that they can crush the gang and ensure the Homeless's safety.\n\nThe next day, the Chief diverts from the route that the girls gave them and leads an MBCC strike team to the hideout where Sandy claims the other kids were hiding. They break in and discover that the location had already been raided by Thou Voodoos, and that they had taken away both the stolen Mania Crystals and the kids inside. Her lie exposed, Sandy tries to go to Crache for protection, but Crache harshly turns her away. The Chief calls for backup from the [[[framework against catastrophe |FAC]]] and [[[Reconstruction Executive Committee]]] and promises her that nothing will happen to the kidnapped Homeless.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nYou guys arrived at the plant where Sandy hid Mania Crystals, but all that was left was a mess and blood everywhere.\nOnly after retrieving the surveillance of the Executive Committee did you learn that it was Thou Voodoos that had robbed the kids and Mania Crystals before you. </i></p>","interrogation4":"The MBCC's stealth team fails to infiltrate Thou Voodoos' headquarters, and the Executive Officer leading their forces demands a direct attack, even though it will mean death for the Homeless hostages. The Chief refuses, and instead sends Crache in alone. She succeeds at assassinating the Voodoos High Priest and eliminates the rest of the gangsters, freeing the captive children. Outside, the Syndicate residents blame the Homeless for bringing the gangsters and the authorities. The children, safe and not afflicted by Mania, are outside of the MBCC's jurisdiction; as the ones with legal administration over Syndicate, it is technically the Executive Committee's decision what happens to them next. However, the Executive Officer shows little interest in anything aside from just releasing them back to the street. He says that those children will just grow up to become some new gang in a few years anyway, so there is no value in helping them now. He then realizes that something still needs to be done to close the case, and decides to arrest Sandy as the instigator of the whole affair. Crache attacks the Officer when he grabs Sandy and refuses the Chief's attempts to convince her to stand down. With no other choice, the Chief uses the [[[shackles |Forbidden Force]]] to restrain her.\n\nThree months later, Crache has attempted to escape from the MBCC several times. Sandy is scheduled to be tried in a month, but the Chief promises to fight for her. They tell Crache that they will fight for all the Homeless and will try to find an organization to adopt them, but Crache accuses them of not even believing that themself. She says that even if some people are trying to change Syndicate so that someday those kids can have a better life, it's too late for them. Even Sandy lied to her, and they have all grown up internalizing the lessons of Syndicate: get stronger, grow up, become the next generation of adults, and create the next generation of Homeless. Crache says that the Chief is truly a good person, and that she's lucky to have become a Sinner so she could be held in the MBCC instead of being left in Syndicate, but that most kids are not so lucky. The Chief admits that they can't promise her anything about the future except that they won't let her face it alone.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nEven though the reality is cruel and desperate, you still believe in miracles and hope, just like you always believe that she can find a way to change the future.\nAll the darkness and hardships that lie ahead, you will face them with her.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"Based on the information provided by the Executive Committee and the 9th Agency, the MBCC organized a search operation for the S-Class Sinner Crache. Finally, with the assistance of several Sinners, Chief succeeded in controlling the subject.","arrestRec2":"According to credible intelligence: Crache is a founding member of the Syndicate organization \"the Homeless\", and it is highly likely that she's its leader.","arrestRec3":"Crache has been protecting \"the Homeless\" for years. Whenever a kid paints a \"Homeless\" emblem nearby, the gangsters who hurt them reportedly get \"punished\".","arrestRec4":"\"The Homeless\" is a relatively loose organization. Under Crache's protection, they hardly face any threats to their safety. They band together to live, and each does their part to find basic necessities.

Thus, there is insufficient evidence to designate \"the Homeless\" as a gang.","servingTerm1":"She resorted to hiding in the shadows many times to dodge all MBCC's fieldwork.

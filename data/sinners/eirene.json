Investigation by the 9th Agency also suggests that Quinn has deep-rooted relations with foreign power, the Campbell family.\n\nConsidering that Quinn's president Eirene has a record of colluding with desert bandits, her intentional concealment of her Sinner identity may suggest a more ambitious intention. Special supervision is therefore required as her true purpose is being further investigated.\n\n--\n\nDue to the subject's powerful espionage and strategizing abilities, most of the previous allegations against her are in fact untrue. For example, the subject's detention by the MBCC is in fact also part of her plan.

On the chessboard, we focus only on each other, racking our brains to corner the opponent.\"\n\"What pure pleasure.\"","interrogation1":"The [[[9th Agency]]] has charged the [[[Chief]]] with uncovering Eirene's backers. They present her with a recording of a conversation between herself and several members of the [[[City Council]]], in which the Councilors encourage her and Quinn to get involved in the [[[Hypercube]]] trade and break the monopoly over Hypercube transport currently held by [[[List of Known Enterprises |Nirvana]]]. The Chief then questions her about her involvement with a new company called Bishop, which is buying up Hypercube mines in [[[Syndicate]]]. Eirene confirms having talked with Bishop, but denies any business involvement with them. The Chief is able to one-up her by revealing leaked shipping manifests from Quinn, showing that they have been illicitly selling and transporting Hypercubes to [[[Outland]]] with the help of [[[List of Minor Characters |Councilor Enoch]]]. They further confirm that Enoch was the one who leaked the recording of their conversation when the MBCC and 9th Agency discovered the illegal activity. With her crimes exposed, Eirene confesses. She tells the Chief that everything she has done was at the behest of her father, Bryce Campbell, the most powerful man in the Outland state of Fraser City, and that even she would never have been able to build Quinn without him pulling the strings. She says that Enoch was the only one who she bribed herself without the guidance of Bryce, and that act of autonomy has turned out to be her downfall.\n\nBack in their office, the Chief tells [[[Nightingale]]] that they don't believe Bryce Campbell should have the power to so closely control such a powerful Sinner from so far away without an equal power behind him. They submit their report to the 9th Agency and request permission to bring Eirene back to Fraser City to investigate the danger that he poses.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nEventually, you confirmed that the people behind Eirene are the Campbells from the Outland, Fraser City. Also, Eirene told you herself that she is Campbell's daughter.\nHowever, you refuse to believe that this clever Sinner standing before you is someone who will allow someone else to manipulate her, even if that someone is her father. </i></p>","interrogation2":"Eirene is hesitant about the plan to return to Fraser City, but she and the Chief play a game of chess. She greatly outmatches them, much the same way that her father did to her when she was young. Eirene says that her merciless defeats to Bryce taught her the lesson that a businessperson should be both decisive and resilient. The Chief sympathizes with the harsh lesson, but Eirene says that Bryce gave her many more trials after that one.\n\nEirene remembers an event from her past, when bandits attacked the Campbell family's desert freighter while she was on board. Eirene hid in the cargo hold, terrified and thinking about the moves in a chess game with her father in order to steady her nerves. When her hiding place was discovered, she shot and killed several of the attackers, determined to defend her family's ship even after the bandits revealed that Bryce Campbell was the one paying them to kill her. She was wounded with a [[[Mania |Mania Weapon]]], but detonated the ship, intending to kill the attackers along with her.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nEirene tells you about her past, and also shows you her resolve.\nEven though you lost this game, Eirene finally agrees to go with you to meet her estranged father. </i></p>","interrogation3":"As Eirene and the Chief finish their chess match, she says that her story was another example of the kinds of trials that Bryce gave. He reached his position by trampling over those around him, and if she had died she would not have been worthy to stand beside him. As evidence, not only did she survive the trial, but it awakened her as a Sinner. Her awakening caused Bryce to say that he was proud of her -- only the second time he had ever said that, after the first time she defeated him at chess. That pride is what spurred him to send her to DisCity to lay the foundation for his plan. She checkmates the Chief, and agrees to accompany them and break Bryce's control over her.\n\nLater, as their sand cruiser travels through the unruled areas of [[[WhiteSands]]], they are attacked by a fleet of Campbell freighters who demand that the Chief either turn back or submit to Bryce Campbell. Eirene takes command of the ship and pilots it to avoid both the attackers and quicksand, reminding the navigator of a saying that \"A Campbell can escape WhiteSands with their eyes closed.\" Despite her skillful maneuvering, the cruiser is hit and disabled by a shell from Bryce's ship, and Eirene confirms that he is the one firing, as even in this she could never beat him. She requests permission to use her ability to fight back, but the Chief only allows her to use it to block further shots, not to attack her father, who she at least once revered. Instead the MBCC forces use sniper rifles to kill the person manning the artillery. Eirene is in disbelief that Bryce could die so easily, but is eager to move on to a new era for the Campbells, reminding the Chief that she has at least ten more siblings in Fraser City.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nThe girl who got attacked in WhiteSands has become a Sinner too when she grew up.\nEirene told you her past and showed you her determination.\nEirene confirms that your attacker is her biological father.\nFaced with Eirene's breakdown, you decide to try and get rid of Bryce Campbell. </i></p>","interrogation4":"Eirene and the Chief inspect the wreckage of Bryce's ship, and she confirms that the body is his. However, the Chief looks closer at the body and finds that it had only been surgically altered to resemble him. They realize that Eirene had misled them the entire time, caused them to think that they were under attack by Bryce, and piloted the ship herself to strand them in an uncharted part of WhiteSands. With the Chief at her mercy, Eirene proposes a deal where the Chief acts as her cover so that she can engage in the Hypercube trade in Syndicate. If they refuse, she will fabricate a story wherein they both were killed by a bandit attack, but she herself will create a new identity for a new business empire in Syndicate. The Chief tells her that while investigating the trade history between DisCity and Fraser City, they uncovered reason to believe that Fraser City's leadership changed eight years ago, and Eirene confirms that in actuality, her relationship with her father collapsed after she became a Sinner. She ultimately tricked him into taking pills which keep him in a sedated, vegetative state, keeping him alive just enough to witness how she becomes the new leader of the Campbell family. The Chief then reveals that trackers from the 9th Agency were hidden aboard the cruiser, anticipating conflict with Eirene, and that they only have to hold out until rescue arrives from the Agency.\n\nWith their leverage evenly matched, Eirene proposes a new match between them. She will peacefully return to the MBCC, but will be allowed to maintain ownership over Quinn and continue her business dealings. The Chief agrees.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nThe matter has been completely exposed before your eyes. Bryce is not dead. You have been misled by Eirene. But Bryce no longer heads the Campbell family, Eirene does now.\nYou resist Eirene's provocations and threats. Eirene admires you and extends a hand, hoping to forge a special deal. </i></p>","arrestRec1":"Voluntarily revealed the dangerous power she holds to the public on an open occasion. Suspected to have turned herself in intentionally for personal reasons. Investigation shows that the subject is not harmful to the MBCC at present, and detainment has been offered.","arrestRec2":"The illegitimate daughter of Bryce Campbell, the head of the Campbell family, and his mistress.

Six years after her relocation, Quinn has become the largest private company in DisCity.

This worsened the father-and-daughter relationship. The subject cultivated her power by herself in the DisCity for several years and launched a counter-attack to her father, controlling Bryce with special means, operating Quinn's acquisitions of Campbell, and secretly rearranging the power within the family.","servingTerm1":"Despite having many tasks to tend to, the subject rarely requests to leave the facility, spending most of her time in the detention room playing chess with herself.

In-house designers from the fashion brands under Quinn also visit monthly to tailor luxurious gowns for her.","servingTerm3":"Quite a few Sinners have been employed by enterprises owned or funded by Quinn, so they're inevitably nervous when going on missions with the former director. But Eirene only vaguely remembers a selected few of these former subordinates and refers to the rest as //insignificant pawns//.","servingTerm4":"Though the subject has never lost in chess with the Chief, she will always enjoy a good game with the Chief and will occasionally even give way or offer guidance so long as the endgame is not affected. \"Witnessing the growth of your own possession is an interesting thing, too.\"","emotionCheck1":"[Eirene holds a financial statement and flips its pages.]\r\n\r\n**Eirene:** Are you here to pay me for last time?\r\n\r\n**Chief:** ......\r\n\r\n* **Prompt:** ...What pay?

With her personal BFL buff however, simply S1 Eirene is enough to obliterate the map paired with meta buffers.<br/><br/>Despite being made largely redundant in BFL, Eirene still has her niches and can be fun to utilise in longer gamemodes such as Mania Training and Eternal Nightmare, and can be useful in story because of her P2/Ult's versatility, with the downtime periods in this mode giving space for Eirene to recharge her Ult."},{"title":"Ultimate","text":"Eirene's Ult has 3 different forms: 1) a 3x3 AoE slow, 2) an X shaped 2 Core Damage, and 3) a single grid burst. Which version you get depends on the state of the enemy your Ult touches- if no Cores: 1; if has Cores: 2; if broken: 3.<br/><br/>Form 3 is the \"best\" version. Form 1 is decent, but using Form 2 is usually ill advised. Using a 40 cost Ult just for Corebreak is likely not worthwhile as there are cheaper Ultimates you can use for this purpose and you are wasting Eirene's only substantial source of damage."},{"title":"Passive 1","text":"Since Eirene's P1 buff is in its own damage zone, it bolsters her Ult damage by a significant amount. Make sure you have this passive fully stacked every time you Ult.<br/><br/>For ease of stacking when playing Eirene hypercarry, Hamel is a recommended pairing since her ECB Ultimate can be spammed to stack Eirene passive. For a demonstration on how to do this, see the Eirene ECB mining guide video in the Media section."},{"title":"Passive 2","text":"Eirene's P2 is underratedly useful. Having extra Chief energy generation means 2 stacks of Last Stand 20 seconds into the battle or a couple of extra Empowers you can use to funnel your carry. It can also feel very nice in battles with long downtime such as story or Mania Training as it can help you recuperate Ultimates for next wave or help set Eirene mines for later detonation. "},{"title":"ECB","text":"Unlocking Eirene's ECB means you unlock a toggle to place Eirene's Ultimates as mines that can be detonated later. Mines can be either triggered by moving an ally onto the mine grid or an enemy's hitbox touching the grid the mine is on.

While this sounds nice, in practice you're unlikely to be getting the full effect of this since there's more to teambuilding decision-making than simply a character's class.

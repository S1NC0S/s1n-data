May you witness the ultimate end.\"","interrogation1":"On the 13th of October N.F. 112, the [[[Chief]]] is wrapping up the loose ends of [[[serpent |Serpent's]]] Mania crisis at the Midsummer Night’s Club. Shalom arrives at the [[[minos bureau of crisis control |MBCC]]] with a personal escort from the higher-ups. It is specified by the [[[framework against catastrophe |FAC]]], [[[9th Agency]]], and [[[Paradeisos]]] that despite being a Sinner, she should not be Shackled, and has been serving the public for 8 years. Chief heads to the interrogation room to speak with her.\n\nShalom greets Chief, saying she was at the Midsummer Night’s Club as well and saw them there. She states correctly that Chief likely cannot remember her, and that her purpose was to assess the MBCC and Chief. She mentions that they previously crossed paths at the MBCC, and tells Chief that they can ask her anything. Chief points at [[[Schorl]]], and Shalom explains that it is an invention from the [[[Ring Research Institute]]], and is able to do many tasks for her. The subject turns to Paradeisos, with Chief expressing wariness about its motives and operations. Shalom directly tells Chief that they can just admit they despise it, and there is no need for pretences with her. She teases Chief by saying she overheard the MBCC staff insulting Paradeisos, causing Chief to nearly choke.\n\nShalom expresses that Paradeisos and the MBCC do not have to be opposed, but also tells Chief to hold firm to their own beliefs and goals. She candidly tells Chief that she simply wanted to see them again as well, and asks them to tell her about their journey in the past two months. [[[Suspect R]]], [[[Zoya]]], [[[Hamel]]], [[[Stargazer]]], and Serpent flash into Chief’s memory. Shalom praises Chief for their accomplishments, but Chief also recalls those they could not save: the [[[Gray Haired Girl]]], [[[036]]], and [[[Earl]]]. Pained, Chief asks Shalom what they used to be like, and if their past self could have handled things better.\n\nShalom reveals that the first time they met was actually earlier that same year, prior to the Chief losing their memory. The Chief used to be a constant source of anger and chaos, and a huge headache for the MBCC. Their second meeting was at the Midsummer Night’s Club, but Shalom realised Chief was on a covert assignment and did not wish to interfere. She notes that when provoked then, Chief did not allow themselves to fall for the trap, and she has seen that Chief has become adept at using words to play with emotions while attempting to fish for information subtly. Shalom clarifies that she is complimenting Chief for having become stronger and more mature, and continues to lavish Chief with compliments and reassuring words.\n\n[[[Nightingale]]] bursts in, and makes up an excuse to take Chief away. Outside, she appears fearful and tells Chief that they must pass this “trial” safely, before leaving. \n\nThe Chief goes to search for old records, but cannot find anything about Shalom’s visit. They attempt to use their Chief credentials to access some confidential records, but are denied. In the MBCC’s daily work logs of the past year, Chief’s name and the title of “MBCC Chief '' both do not appear–it seems that the position of Chief was vacant for nearly an entire year prior to the prison break, with Nightingale managing all official duties. \n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Shalom is not only an envoy for Paradeisos, but also someone you’ve known for a long time. She knows your current situation and about your past… But many discrepancies keep you on your toes: Is she really an “old friend” you can trust?</i></p>","interrogation2":"The next day, [[[list of minor characters |Wynn]]] is found praising Shalom’s kindness and gentle personality with other MBCC staff. Shalom is shown to be highly aware of her surroundings, smiling enigmatically, while Nightingale is deeply afraid of her. Chief is worried that the entire Bureau might be falling under her control and considers Shackling her. Shalom comes up to Chief, and they invite her on a field mission to intercept smugglers.\n\nOn the field, [[[Hella]]] is easily swayed by Shalom’s praises. It is noted that Shalom observes [[[Hecate]]] closely with an unusual hint of caution. During that moment of distraction, a blast of Mania firepower attacks the Chief and Nightmare shields them but leaves the other three exposed. Shalom reacts, with Schorl instantly destroying the ambush and devastating the area in blinding blue light. She also steps in front of Hecate, shielding her from the attack and getting hit in the shoulder in the process.\n\nAs she leaves, Shalom whispers to Chief derisively, asking if they thought she was going to harm Hecate without reason. Chief contemplates the events of the mission later on, frustrated that they cannot understand her motives at all. However, they soon decide that they must hold to their own conviction and path as always, and send a message requesting to meet her. \n\nIn Shalom’s room, Chief speaks candidly and asks Shalom to properly state her position and motives. Shalom agrees, sending Schorl away, then somehow immobilises Chief with a strange light. She persuades Chief to Shackle her and they try to, but an aggressive force inside her pierces out of Shalom’s body in response; another Shackle. Chief is shocked by this, and as they both fall unconscious, Shalom reveals that the those Shackles were placed on her by the Chief before they lost their memory. \n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>You can’t release the shackles because of Schorl’s obstruction. Shalom’s attitude is ambiguous. You’re skin to skin, yet her heart is a mystery. You finally unearth fragments from her past.</i></p>","interrogation3":"Chief opens their eyes and finds themselves in the Consciousness [[[Observatorium]]], the outermost boundary where human reason can venture into Mania. They move forwards, coming to a narrow rift. Shalom appears out of nowhere, advising them not to go closer. Chief releases the Shackles on instinct, but nothing happens. Shalom tells Chief to give up, as Mania has no sway where they are. She explains that the realm of primordial [[[Deep Mania]]] exists beyond the rift, and that anything that ventures into it will instantly warp and disintegrate. Should a [[[Black Ring]]] fully evolve, it will forge a link to this place. She smiles and explains that she brought Chief here so that they can truly speak freely, as only those with a unique link to this realm can access it, and promises to be truthful where she can, straightforward where she cannot.\n\nThe questions begin; Shalom confirms that her visit is both a greeting and a test to gauge the loyalty of the MBCC’s Chief, as Paradeisos wishes to entrust greater responsibilities to them. She explains that as long as Chief does not make an enemy of [[[DisCity]]], Paradeisos will not harm them. Shalom smiles, but this time Chief notices that it is extremely empty, to the point where it seems as though Shalom is only a husk of a human. She states again that the [[[Shackles]]] on her belonged to the Chief from before their memory loss, and hypothesises that as Chief’s sense of identity has shifted, they lost the ability to link to their old Shackles. Chief attempts to bait Shalom into revealing more by pretending to back off, but she calls them out on this. As a friend, she asks how Chief would feel if she says that Chief’s past self was a fearsome monster who left destruction in their wake, that everything Chief actually cared for was taken away. She asks if Chief would want all that power back, and all of this makes the Chief’s resolve waver. However, Chief focuses and realises that their entire conversation had been a test from Paradeisos. Shalom congratulates Chief on passing the test and informs them that she will be leaving the MBCC.\n\nShalom bids Chief farewell, then suddenly pushes them into the rift. They land in a sea of flowers that feel strangely familiar, and catch some fragments of Shalom’s memories; this is her way of telling Chief more as a ‘friend’, without breaking the [[[Rules]]].\n\nKnown as Subject 17, young Shalom was a Sinner who harboured intense hatred towards the researchers. As a result of her dissent, she was selected for a trial experiment. The emotional part of herself was ripped out as a monster called [[[Rebel]]], and sent into the Deep Mania.  \n\n[[[Operation Eclipse]]] results in the recycling of the 6th [[[Hush]]], and Shalom is promoted to Hush-X, the 7th Hush. With the role, she inherited the Second Observation Chamber and the No. 2 Schorl, who is anchored in Rebel. Paradeisos informed her that as [[[mark |Marking]]] consumes a lot of resources, only exceptionally valuable dissenters would be Marked, and the rest merely Shackled. Shortly thereafter, Paradeisos remarks to her about the beginning of the conflict with [[[Rustfire]]] that would lead to [[[BR-002]]], and that they are keen to discover the true nature of what they retrieved within the [[[Lone Island]]] base and the [[[Underground’s]]] intentions for it. They give Shalom her first observation mission: to seek out the [[[source |Ultimate Answer]]] identify pathways to it.\n\nThe Chief sees Rebel in the flower field, before being expelled out of the realm. Hecate wakes them, saying they had passed out for 4 hours. Nightingale and Hella appear, deeply worried but relieved.\n\nIn her car, Shalom and Schorl speak. She notes that Chief has ingested three [[[corpus |Corpuses]]], and Schorl responds that based on prior data, that ‘container’ is on the verge of failure, also stating that Chief is ‘defective’. Shalom dismisses the concern, saying that despite being the final flawed specimen, Chief’s stability is remarkable. Schorl begins to talk about the next generation of Hush, focusing on the marking capabilities and aiming to use Hush to detain Sinners. Shalom excuses herself, saying she is tired.\n\nMonths later, Paradeisos members hold a conversation regarding the possibility of using a [[[Purge Order]]] in [[[Syndicate]]] as the chaos and risk of another Black Ring in the district have grown too great. Shalom thinks to herself that the damage Paradeisos is willing to inflict far outstrips the harm from the Black Ring they claim to despise and derides the way their aims have been compromised by fear. However, she knows clearly that she can never voice those thoughts as it would likely result in her immediate destruction. Paradeisos orders her to orchestrate the simultaneous destruction of both the Chief and the [[[Corpseborne]]] of [[[BR-002]]]. She confirms her orders but makes an alternate suggestion: rather than going to such lengths to prevent BR-002 from reappearing, they catalyse the explosion of the Black Ring and thus lure out the [[[Underground Shepherd]]] in order to annihilate her. Her suggestion scares Paradeisos, but she asks if the destruction of the Underground Shepherd is truly what they want, turning their own reliance on logic against them. To herself, she answers the Chief's old question: that what she wants, her true goal, is them. With six months left in her operational life, Shalom resolves to find the Ultimate Answer.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>After the investigation, you rush to a new battlefield. Shalom moves on to her next “mission”: To turn into the sharpest tool and orchestrate a grand blooming of flowers.</i></p>\n","interrogation4":"On the 21st of June, N.F. 113, Shalom’s group of operatives locate Chief on the edge of Syndicate. While her underlings battle Rustfire, she slips out of the firefight into a side door, and finds the Chief's comatose body. She releases her power a little, finding that the Shackles are not fighting back against her Mark. However, before she can use the Mark, she is assaulted by the Mania of BR-002 through the Chief's body. The [[[Rules]]] force her to recoil, and Schorl is simultaneously fried by a burst of electricity before and launched out of the window. As soon as Schorl is gone, Shalom stands up, composed. [[[Donald]]] bursts in and attempts to battle her for possession of the Chief, but his power is restricted by Shalom’s old Mark on him. [[[matilda |A sniper]]] fires through the window, striking Shalom through the throat. She collapses onto the ground, and Donald seizes the chance to take the Chief away. Through the Mark, Shalom tells Donald to run as far as they can and keep the Chief safe. With her assigned mission failed but her secret goal achieved, Shalom thinks about what other safeguards she can layer upon the Chief without arousing Paradeisos’s suspicion.\n\nShalom continues to reflect on what has happened to her, the agony and struggles of Rebel day after day, its grotesque oppression of its own kind, and wonders if she can even be considered human anymore. She recalls her first meeting with Chief at the MBCC. After witnessing a distraught Nightingale fleeing from a holding cell, Shalom enters and finds Chief restrained in a straightjacket. She says that her mission is to neutralize lingering side-effects from prior operations and stabilize their condition; she attempts to Mark the Chief, but they turn the tables and Shackle her instead, fighting and yelling that they will never forgive. The Shackles caused a fracture in the removal of her emotions, allowing her to feel pain and fear once again. Shalom is able to feel hatred for Paradeisos once again, and begins plotting to destroy Paradeisos’s cowardly designs.\n\nShalom arrives at Erica Villa, and flashes of [[[Christina]]], [[[Coquelic]]], and [[[Rahu]]] are shown in the days leading up to the [[[hypercube |Blue Rain]]] alert of July N.F. 113. Shalom sees [[[Garofano]]] attacking her, and accepts that events have started to move, wishing for both herself and Chief to find their freedom.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>In July N.F. 113, HUSH X went to Erica VIlla in Eastside. In August of the same year, the Battle of West District officially began. X was confirmed to have deviated, and the Observatorium was contaminated. The HUSH system was urgently shut down.\n\nThe journey is treacherous. May those venturing against the tide eventually find freedom.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"The subject, identifying as a Paradeisos official, suddenly visited the MBCC for a short-term inspection visit.","arrestRec2":"Currently visiting the MBCC as a Paradeisos representative, the subject claims to frequently meet and share a personal relationship with the current Chief in the past.

Maybe it's time to cut off the supply?\n\n**System Notifications:** When Shalom joined the Bureau, she didn't leave behind her massive trove.

And that's how you can really get to know Sinners better, by seeing what they choose.\n\n**Chief:** I've been wondering... why collect all these different kinds of music, movies, and books, only to lend them out willy-nilly? Are you trying to find something in them? Maybe something you're missing yourself?\n\n**Shalom:** Hehe, relax, it's not a battle. Music, movies, and books are all means people use to express their thoughts and feelings. And the way people choose and connect with them?

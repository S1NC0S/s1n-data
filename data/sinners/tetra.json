Please investigate promptly.\n\n* **Prompt:** Ask Tetra\n\n**Chief:** Do you have any leads on this?\n\n**Tetra:** As soon as you hear something's missing, you come straight to me. You really have a lot of \"trust\" in me, Chief.\n\n**Tetra:** Tell me, what are you looking for?\n\n* **Prompt:** Check the lost items list\n\n**Chief:** Four boxes of cream, six jars of large candies, ten sets of stationery...\n\n**Tetra:** Hmm... Doesn't ring a bell. I've handled countless treasures, these little trinkets are far from memorable to me.\n\n**Chief:** ...And twelve rabbit plush.\n\n**Tetra:** Hmm... Wait, are you talking about that \"Robber Rabbit\" thing?\n\n**Chief:** You remember now?\n\n**Tetra:** Maybe.

You're the Chief of the MBCC, after all. But, if the logistics department doesn't learn their lesson, I can't guarantee that the items won't \"disappear\" again."}

She visited DisCity as a member of the Eastian delegation. Possessing a prophetic gift for sensing <i>divine will</i> and conveying <i>oracles</i>, she actively cooperated with the DisCity authorities to counter the Apostle of Ashes <i>Sun Crow</i>. However, during her temporary stay in DisCity, her abilities were unstable, resulting in disruptions to routine operations, damage to public property, and public disorder. Detention and supervision of the subject during her temporary stay in DisCity is recommended.\n\n--\n\nIt has been clarified that the subject's abilities are closely related to the customs and geography of Eastia, so their effectiveness is limited in DisCity. Additionally, she was deeply demoralized by the failure of the Sun Shot, leading to a series of unintentionally inaccurate <i>prophecies</i>. Her true character is sincere and lively and she always acts out of goodwill. She gradually regained her abilities and faith as a seer during her temporary stay in DisCity, under the guidance and companionship of Chief. She has now left DisCity to return to Eastia. Supervision for the subject has come to an end for now.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\nThe subject can manipulate special flames. As her usual weapon is a slingshot, she typically condenses flames into fireballs with a radius of less than 10cm and shoots them. Additionally, she possesses a mysterious <i>prophetic gift</i> which occasionally subjects her to disturbing visions of <i>oracles</i> and makes her convey information from unknown sources in an unconscious state.\n\n+++* Awakening Signs\nAccording to the subject, she sustained a disaster in her childhood which led to the loss of her parents and home. In a critical situation, she heard a mysterious calling and was taken over by visions. She claims that she saw the <i>god</i> at that moment, and that was when her power awakened.\n\n+++* Corruption State\nModerate degree of corruption despite lack of mutations on the body surface. She is usually sane, but will become unconscious when she is <i>possessed to convey oracles</i>, during which her mind becomes unstable.","ecbFlavourText":"\"I'm certain.

Once, she mistook a plate of salad for a raw ingredient and stir-fried it, but the dish received surprisingly positive feedback.","servingTerm3":"With her genuine and lively personality, she has quickly become a beloved figure among the Sinners during her stay at the Bureau. She has grown especially close to the Sinners from Eastia. Although her boundless curiosity and barrage of questions sometimes overwhelm some Sinners, the situation is gradually improving.","servingTerm4":"She invited Chief to join the <i>DisCity Myth Tour</i> she organized. Some of its highlights include an ethereal, incorporeal beautiful lady, a talking glowing tablet, and a highly addictive herbal soup. The tour lasted 18 hours and 21 minutes. After that, Chief decided to start reading the encyclopedia to get better prepared for next time.","interrogation1":"The Eastian delegation has left DisCity, but Yanyan has stayed behind. The Chief had instructed their staff to take Yanyan's prophecies seriously, but she has predicted a string of disasters for various departments in the Bureau, none of which have come true. The Chief is reluctantly forced to have a conversation with Yanyan about it. When they sit to talk with her, she quickly launches into her latest prophetic dream, this one about an evil spirit born in an alley untouched by sunlight. Despite Yanyan's urgency, the Chief is unmoved. They ask her why she decided to stay in DisCity and when she plans on leaving, but she shiftily keeps trying to move the conversation back to her new prophecy. Eventually, the Chief lays out the reports of her failed predictions. Yanyan tries to make excuses as to why things didn't turn out as she expected, but eventually she admits that she has been having issues with her ability. She says that ever since the Sun Crow was vanquished, her predictions have become less reliable. They realize that her powers are based on faith, and that her failure to defeat the Sun Crow with her sun shot shook her belief in herself. She has avoided going home to Eastia because she doesn't believe she can be a good seer like this, but the more she worries, the worse her predictions become.\n\nThe Chief regrets their negligence, which has allowed Yanyan to become so anxious without even noticing. They decide that to replenish her self-confidence as a seer, they need to show her that she can still help protect people, and they decide to start with her new evil spirit prophecy.\n\n//Struck by reality, Yanyan admits something is wrong with her abilities. To help repair her power and faith, you decide to take her to verify her latest prophecy.//","interrogation2":"The evil spirit in the alley that Yanyan predicted turns out to just be an open sewer grate, but Yanyan at least saves an old woman from falling into it. She is initially disappointed by another failed prophecy, but she's quickly distracted as the old woman turns out to be searching for aliens. Excited by this new adventure, Yanyan insists on going with her to the next location on her search, a magical wishing tree. Their endeavor is predictably fruitless, but Yanyan and the old woman quickly bond, as the woman reminds Yanyan of her granny and Yanyan reminds the woman of her daughter. Eventually, the old woman reveals that her daughter died when she was young, and that she began alien hunting because of her daughter's fascination with them. Her daughter also died with a secret wish, which the woman has always guessed was to know whether aliens were real. In order to help this woman, Yanyan is determined to use her ability to divine what the girl's final wish really was.\n\n//The old lady who resembles Yanyan's grandmother has a sorrowful past. Moved by her story, Yanyan decides to help her fulfill her wish after careful consideration.//","interrogation3":"Yanyan tries to channel the spirit of the old woman's dead daughter. Her power fluctuates wildly and it causes her intense anguish as she relives all the disasters of her life and all her failures during the Sun Crow operation. She snaps out of it once and the woman begs her to stop, but Yanyan brushes her off. The Chief backs Yanyan up and insists that she knows her own limits. Yanyan makes another attempt, and this time, she succeeds at channeling the dead girl's spirit into her body. The old woman and her daughter happily reconnect, sharing stories and photos about her alien investigations. But before long, the girl's spirit begins to fade. The old woman asks what wish her daughter died with, and she replies that it doesn't matter, because it's already been fulfilled. Her only remaining wish is for her mother to live out the rest of her life safely and happily.\n\nYanyan returns to her senses. She apologizes to the old woman for not being able to channel longer, as her skills are still developing, but the woman has nothing but gratitude toward her. Yanyan thanks her too for giving her the chance to get back her motivation as a seer. Several days later, Yanyan returns to Eastia. She is back to the cheerful girl she was before, but has also gained a sense of purpose and confidence that she never had. She and the Chief both agree that by the next time they meet, she will surely be Eastia's greatest seer.\n\n//Having shed her doubts and concerns, Yanyan grows like a sun-facing flower toward her goal as a reliable seer.\nAt the moment of farewell, you make a pinky promise with each other about the luminous future.//","voicelines":[{"Sinner":"Yanyan","Tag":"Base","Obtain the Sinner - EN":"What exactly does your M...

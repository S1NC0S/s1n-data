She is suspected to have orchestrated countless attacks against the elite, and also to have deep ties with the Underground. She exposed her tracks during a mission against Paradeisos officials, and is listed as a priority for detainment due to the highly destabilizing impact of her actions.\n\n--\n\nThe Garden exists in name only, as the subject ceased her activities as an assassin after being detained. Currently, she is committed to the MBCC, working with the Bureau in detaining Sinners. Moreover, investigations revealed that the Garden's catalyst in creating Sinners was the doing of the previous Mentor, not Coquelic. According to performance records, the subject's emotions are stable, and she rarely uses her power.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThe subject can turn her mental energy into a Mania Flower and attach it to a target to control, attack or heal.

A Garden member asks a listless Coquelic if she would like to move the Garden to a new location, but Coquelic refuses, and angrily insists that “there’s no Garden anymore”. She bitterly thinks that [[[Shalom]]] must have put her [[[Mark]]] on her after all, as Coquelic had almost believed her. A flashback shows a deeply wounded Coquelic meeting with [[[Thistle]]] and some other members, but many more (including [[[Garofano]]]) are still missing. [[[Christina]]] claimed that most of them were sent to [[[Syndicate]]], hence the reason Coquelic is currently there. Back in the present, Coquelic muses to herself that she likely only has about a week left to live.\n\nSeveral days pass, and Coquelic seems to be waiting for someone, perpetually lost in thought. The members of the Garden talk about the present circumstances, but Coquelic stays put, insisting that ‘the last threat’ to the Garden will come. \n\nSure enough, the day comes and the [[[minos bureau of crisis control |MBCC]]] arrest team surrounds the house with [[[Nightingale]]] at the helm. She announces that the [[[Chief]]] has ordered for the Mentor to be captured no matter what. Coquelic unleashes her [[[Mania]]] power at great cost to her health, allowing the rest of the Garden to escape. Eventually she falls under the hail of bullets, and Chief [[[Shackles]]] her. She wakes in the interrogation room.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Coquelic was severely injured, but still cast her powerful Mania power to resist the arrest team’s attack. In the end, the exhausted Coquelic got detained, but the other Garden members remain unaccounted for.</i></p>\n","interrogation2":"Coquelic attempts to test the strength of the Shackles while acting playful with Chief. The Chief requests that they exchange information about the incidents that transpired at [[[Erica Villa]]] and Coquelic summarises Garofano’s mission perfunctorily, but Chief dismisses the pretence and hands her a thick stack of evidence; that the Garden has always targeted [[[Paradeisos]]], and that their weapons and ability to convert people to Sinners come from the [[[Underground]]]. Coquelic laughs and finally comes clean, mentioning that she killed the previous Mentor and took her place, and also that their client for Shalom’s assassination was [[[Segal]]].\n\nCoquelic requests information from Chief about the Shackles: specifically, how it binds Sinners. Chief claims that they only use it to hold Mania levels down, but not to restrict Sinners. Coquelic challenges them, digging her nails into Chief’s wrist and causing them to bleed. Chief feels an intense mental pain, and finally guesses that Coquelic’s reason for allowing herself to be caught was to kill them (presumably to free [[[Sumire]]], [[[Gekkabijin]]], and Garofano from the Shackles). Chief eventually unleashes the Shackles to fend her off, but Coquelic takes this as a sign of Chief’s hypocrisy. They both collapse, unconscious, a single poppy blooming on their hands.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>A physical examination revealed that Coquelic is nearing the end of her life. Even in her weakest moments, she risked death to fight against the MBCC. Perhaps she can’t even explain the motive behind her radical actions herself…</i></p>","interrogation3":"In a flashback of her memories, it is shown that Coquelic lost her [[[framework against catastrophe |FAC]]] parents at a young age. Furious, she makes a pact with Mania to become a Sinner. She states that she wishes to live a life where no one else can judge the value of her life, and to be strong enough to live for herself. After many years, she succeeds in taking her revenge on the [[[DisCity]]] official who was in charge of the operation leading to her parents’ deaths. However, while conversing with her Mentor, Coquelic realises that shee too had sacrificed Garden members as bait and treated it as something “honourable”, just like the FAC had. Coquelic kills her and usurps the Mentor’s role, determined to protect ‘her flowers’. \n\nAs time passes, Coquelic recalls supporting the ambitions and wishes of Garofano, Gekkabijin, Thistle, and Sumire; though they are all different, she does not place her judgements upon them. Coquelic’s consciousness returns to the present, and she accepts her impending death. She thinks about how she has managed to protect her Garden from the final threat (the Shackles), but suddenly sees flashbacks of the Garden assassins clinging on to her. Still in denial, she claims these ‘final attachments’ are ridiculous, that she has always lived only for herself. However, she is shocked to her senses when an apparition of Sumire asks why she is still waiting for them to appear.\n\nBackground dialogue reveals that the MBCC’s medical team are trying to save her by transferring all her Mania to Chief, even exceeding the limit of the Shackles. Coquelic finally admits to herself that everything she has done was not out of pure self-interest, but for the sake of her Garden.    \n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>There are still those who are waiting for her to wake up, and those who are using their frail bodies to shield her from danger. Coquelic sees her past self and finds the purpose of carrying on.</i></p>\n","interrogation4":"Sumire is caring for Coquelic in her ward. The latter reads a file that Sumire brought with her, which the Chief plans to send to the [[[9th Agency]]] to claim that all members of the Garden except Coquelic have been killed (thus freeing all the members from being hunted). Sumire reveals that Chief had intended to submit the report even before Coquelic’s interrogation, and tries to convince her that the Chief has the same caring attitude towards Sinners that Coquelic has towards the Garden.\n\nCoquelic goes to visit Chief, and is shocked by their injuries. The two banter a little, but eventually get serious; Coquelic says she will tell Chief anything they want to know under three conditions.\n\nLater that night, Sumire and Gekkabijin are seen visiting Coquelic in her ward. She tells them about the conversation with Chief: The conditions were 1) That the MBCC has to track down all remaining Garden Sinners in secret, and Shackle them to suppress their Mania. 2) To not expose the existence of the Garden Sinners, and to not restrict or control them. 3) For Chief to cherish their own life. The Chief had chastised her, and suggested that they both abide by the third agreement. Garofano appears, having finally recovered, and says Thistle is also doing well. Gekkabijin asks again about the third agreement, and Coquelic responds in a roundabout way: that in the next crisis, she will continue to fight and protect them with all her power. And when the time for her death comes, she hopes her actions will be able to protect her Garden forever.\n\nElsewhere, Nightingale shows the Chief that the poppy from the interrogation has withered; Chief correctly takes this to mean that Coquelic has refused to abide by the third agreement. By being willing to die for the Garden, she silently sends the message that she has turned over the future of the Garden to Chief.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Someone’s got to shield these little flowers from the storm. Even if that means decomposing into the mud… This is her newfound purpose for carrying on. “The Garden is now in your hands, Chief.”</i></p>","arrestRec1":"She was commissioned to launch targeted attacks on Paradeisos officials and the FAC. After the attack failed, she faked the destruction of the organization, led the remnants of the Garden to hide their identities, and took refuge in Syndicate. Later, due to the abnormal M-value caused by the gathering of Sinners, she was discovered and detained by the MBCC. She fiercely resisted during the detainment process.","arrestRec2":"The subject's parents were both FAC members. Due to their work, she was constantly moving from place to place with them. After her parents were killed on duty, she rejected all offers of care and condolences.","arrestRec3":"Years later, the subject began to be active as a Sinner of the Garden. During this time, she was personally involved in dozens of Eastside officials' deaths, including the commander in the incident where her parents were killed.","arrestRec4":"According to the subject, she seized the position of \"Mentor\" because she could not agree with the Garden's ethos. Under Coquelic's leadership, the Garden became a neutral organization independent from the Underground, and took on various deals while adopting a laissez-faire attitude towards the Sinners under its control.","servingTerm1":"The subject claims to be physically weak and requires assistance with everything in life, including but not limited to eating, bathing, and going out. In particular, she has stringent requirements for the temperature of her baths and the type of petal shampoo to be used on specific days. Most of these requests have been rejected by the Bureau. ","servingTerm2":"She likes to \"moonbathe,\" claiming that the night makes her more alert, and that her face looks better under the moonlight.

However, when asked about her own gardening achievements, she simply gazes towards the Sinners from the Garden. ","servingTerm4":"She often refers to the members of the Garden as \"little flowers,\" and recently, has also begun to refer to the Chief that way. She's also carefully selecting flowers that could symbolize the Chief, planning to plant them in her own flower bed.

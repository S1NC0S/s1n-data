The subject may also have potential of prophetic dream, which is yet to be further confirmed.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nBorn with special power. The laboratory's cultivation and and strengthening have enhanced the subject's strength and functionality.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nIt can be inferred from an experiment report of unknown origin that S-019 is a born Sinner and an experimental subject. In S-019's early years, there has been frequent late-stage mutation symptoms, terrible nightmares that make it difficult to sleep, severe internal body erosion, and the subject possesses a high risk to the outside. The end of the report includes the life expectancy of S-019: 14 years.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Everything that's mine will also be yours.\"\n\"This is the purpose of Hecate.\"","arrestRec1":"The subject was handed over to the MBCC as a \"test body\" to control the use of special powers.","servingTerm1":"The subject is unusually quiet and able to stay in the room alone for an entire day if without order.

However, I don't think Miss Nightingale will ever agree to that.","mirage":"++++* Lonely Island\n\nFrom their office, the Chief is transported to an unknown space. There they see Hecate, who asks why they're there before bursting into a ray of light. She is replaced by a much younger version of herself, belted down to a laboratory table. The older Hecate's voice echoes in their head, telling them to leave this nightmare, and the Chief realizes that they are dressed in the garb of one of the lab's technicians. All they are carrying is a single strawberry candy in their pocket. The voice of their supervisor informs them that the experiment is about to start, and their only task is to increase the dosage applied. Sensing the Chief's hesitation, they tell them that Hecate is not human and one way or another, will not wake up until the experiment is complete.\n\nThe supervisor refers to the substance being dosed as \"Type-I compound\" and promises to rebuild what's ruined, saying that Sinner powers are worth the costs. Records of other experiments show dosages increased until the Sinner subject became Manic. Regulations detail instructions for the researchers to study a Sinner's ability without causing their mirage to overflow. The Chief defies their orders and eases Hecate's pain, but their supervisor says that they are only prolonging her suffering. They instruct the Chief to give her a blue pill that will help her quickly recover back to the baseline required for the experiment. \n\nHecate is awake but silent as the Chief inspects her. The Chief asks how she is, and she only asks for the pill in response. The Chief reaches for it, but accidentally drops the strawberry candy from their pocket instead. They give it to her, and she hesitantly eats it. She asks if she can stop taking the drug, but the Chief cannot promise her that. Instead, Hecate asks if she will be able to taste candy again in the future and the Chief tells her that she will. She smiles, and an alert warns that her Sinner energy is overflowing. As the Chief's consciousness fractures, they see Hecate crying and yelling uncontrollably. They see the technician's body lying on the floor as they consciousnes returns to reality.\n\nThe real Hecate apologizes and explains that the Chief just witnessed her dream. They ask if that really happened, and Hecate gives a noncommital answer. They both hope that next time, the Chief will be able to see one of her sweet dreams.\n\n//In the end, the maiden fails to escape the lonely island.//\n//But the candies given to her, to helping hands lent to her,//\n//Will be forever etched in her heart.//","baseVoicelines":"[Obtain the Sinner]\nI've been waiting for you all this time.\n\n[Raise to Phase 1]\nAs long as you need me, I'll always stay by your side.\n\n[Raise to Phase 3]\nEverything that's mine will also be yours.

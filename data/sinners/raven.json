The subject also infiltrated the [[[reconstruction executive committee |Executive Committee]]] as an undercover agent and participated in the [[[Rustfire]]] unrest.\n\nAccording to a lengthy investigation, the subject was found to have been responsible for spreading false information both online and in tabloids. She wantonly distorted facts, made inflammatory remarks, and fed her readers large amounts of disinformation. The subject seriously disrupted social order and must be arrested immediately.\n\n--\n\nThe subject's provocative behavior is actually aimed at Syndicate's evildoers, and her ultimate goal is to incite people to wipe them out.\n\nAfter coming to the MBCC, the subject developed a strong interest in Chief, and has shifted her focus from writing fake news to composing literary works for Chief. Moreover, anything she wants to publish has to now undergo the Bureau's strict review, making it difficult for her to incite others.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\nThe subject can user her power to \"infect\" ink with Mania and thus control and manipulate it.

There, Raven appears in her usual dramatic fashion spouting poetry; [[[Chief]]] remarks that it seems very much like the scene was staged by someone to lure the MBCC out. An odd cawing sound interrupts Raven, and Chief politely tells Wynn to check the bag of “contaminated” items next to her. A crow flies out of the bag and explodes into a puddle of ink. All the items are stained with suspicious ink marks, proving that Raven was the one who set up the scene. Chief shackles Raven, and brings her back to the MBCC.\n\nIn the interrogation room, Raven reveals that she had simply needed to get the MBCC’s attention, to ask Chief to assist her with building a school in Syndicate. When Raven says that she will be the teacher, Chief points out that the kids she taught all ran away when she went to [[[Eastside]]]. In return, Raven humorously points out that a lot of Sinners locked up in the MBCC ran away while Chief was asleep. Upon seeing Chief’s dark expression, she quickly changes the subject.\n\nIt is implied that while Raven studied in a proper Eastside university, she did not graduate. She plans to borrow textbooks from Eastside for the curriculum, altering them slightly to appeal to Syndicate children. Chief realises that Raven cannot be trusted with the construction of the school alone, and decides to help her.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>In the end, you agreed to Raven’s request to build a school. To ensure that Raven doesn’t squander the budget, you decided to keep in touch with her and start preparing the textbooks needed for Syndicate Academy as soon as possible.</i></p>\n","interrogation2":"At the construction site, Raven hands Chief the promotional brochures she made. Over the next few days, curious children begin to appear around the school grounds, though they hide when Raven looks at them. Chief brings Raven some textbooks from Eastside, and most of them get her approval; with the exception of the history textbook. [[[list of minor characters |Ica]]], calls her by her real name ‘Miss Raye’, and expresses his interest in learning poetry from her. He seems wary about her teaching abilities in other subjects, and Raven correctly guesses that those remarks were made by [[[Crache]]]. The latter appears from the shadows, admitting she had read Raven’s books multiple times while criticising the difficulty curve of her past curriculum. Raven reassures her of the legitimacy of the new curriculum, but Crache quietly asks if the textbooks from Eastside record the troubled history of Syndicate. The children leave. Raven and Chief read the history textbooks, and note that Syndicate is either glossed over or completely erased from the contents. Dejected, Raven confesses that she needs Chief’s advice.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Raven accepted the textbooks you brought her, but when it came to the specifics of compiling the history curriculum, she seemed quite lost. \n\nShe needs your help and advice.</i></p>\n","interrogation3":"Raven brings Chief to her office, crammed full of photos, clippings, and so on. Chief notes that it is a quarter of the size of the MBCC’s archive. Raven proudly informs Chief that the items are all records about the history of Syndicate from N.F. 81 to N.F. 114. She reveals that she started collecting these items since she moved to Eastside as a child. Inspired by the heroes she saw on the news, she started writing, and eventually became a writer for [[[syndicate |Yagyu’s]]] newspaper. After a year, in N.F. 103, the newspaper sent her to a war-torn Syndicate. She quickly became part of Rustfire, reporting on the tensions between [[[Nirvana]]] and the miners. After [[[BR-002]]] exploded, she returned to Eastside, trying to publicise the heroic deeds of Syndicans. However, any reporters writing about Nirvana at the time were forced into retracting their articles on threats of torture. Raven was called into Eastside’s [[[Public Security Bureau]]] so frequently that she claims she had been there more times than she had gone home.\n\nHer stubbornness eventually made her a target for DRD, Nirvana’s special department. She was accused of disrupting public order and spreading false information, but Raven refused to confess to the accusations. As punishment, she was tortured horrifically. Eventually, she was thrown into a detention centre, where she met some Syndican kids who mocked the guards every day. She would cheer them on through a barred window, and eventually Miles, one of the kids, spoke to her. He told her that he wants to move to Eastside, but that he heard one has to know how to write to go there. Raven claimed to be a teacher, capable of teaching him how to write in exchange for him getting her poems out. She taught Miles and told him stories about Syndican heroes ([[[Julien]]] and [[[Donald]]]). Miles eventually changed his mind about going to Eastside as Raven’s stories made him feel that Syndicate was actually a good place. This caused Raven to wish that she was a real teacher, so she could have taught him more, taught him better things. However, Raven’s poems were discovered and she was placed under even tighter control. She began to write using brick and plaster, and even her own blood. She eventually grew too weak and lost consciousness, but not before she saw the words on the wall sprout wings and fly out of the iron bars. Later, one of the crows returned with a note from Miles, thanking her. \n\nAs a Sinner, the guards could not do anything to her and she was eventually released. Raven had met Donald in the [[[banyan medical |Banyan Fourth Hospital]]], and despite his pleas, she told Julien that he was alive. As part of Rustfire, she joined the [[[Reconstruction Executive Committee]]] undercover. Impressed, Chief opens the history textbook Raven has been writing but finds it mostly blank. Raven explains, pained, that Miles had learned to hate Syndicate’s enemies from her stories and had gotten himself killed. She worries that the truth may be too much for the children of Syndicate to bear. Chief comforts her, telling her that in tomorrow’s class, she will be giving them the choice to choose for themselves.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Raven’s past makes her fearful of teaching the truth to children ,afraid that they will be crushed by the cruel truth.\n\nBut regardless, children have the right to learn about Syndicate’s history.</i></p>\n","interrogation4":"On the first day of classes, Raven sets up the tables and chairs on the playground area. All the kids from [[[The Homeless]]] are sent there by Crache, who is also present. Chief notices an enrollment application form from [[[Hella]]], which pleases them. Raven’s crows deliver the textbooks to the children, aweing them. The first classes go well, until history class rolls around. Raven tells Chief that she is neither prepared nor unprepared, and begins the lesson by asking the students to look in their textbooks for what happened in N.F. 98. The students state that there is nothing about that year in the textbooks. One student mentions that their older brother had told them about Rustfire’s activities in that year. Delighted, Raven tells the students that if they have experienced it, it must have happened even if it is not recorded in the textbooks and she tears the page off. Following this, she and the students recount the [[[Eclipse Operation]]] of N.F. 103, but one student complains that there is nothing about Syndicate in the textbook. Many students voice that Rustfire helped their families back then, and they tear off another page. The same pattern continues for N.F. 108, where students talk about the reconstruction of Rustfire and Donald’s return to Rustfire. In the end, only the covers of the history textbook remain.  After the class, Raven remarks to Chief that the children have surprised her with their strength and bravery.\n\nSome time later, two students are chatting. One mentions that [[[list of minor characters |Lavina]]] is teaching Maths at the school. They wonder how Raven and Lavina managed to endure all the horrific events of the past. Overhearing them, Raven tosses a piece of chalk at them for gossiping, and asks them to recite her poem “To the Future”, a piece about enduring hope and courage.\n\nCrache says that she’s heard “To the Future” is unfinished, and asks Raven when she plans to complete it. Raven responds that there will be plenty of heroes in Syndicate's future, and that that will keep her busy.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The most dazzling flowers bloom above the fire and ashes.\n\nThe children are much stronger than Raven ever imagined.\n\nHardship has shaped them, and they will be remembered as part of history.</i></p>\n","arrestRec1":"The subject planned to establish a school in Syndicate, but due to the limitations in reality, she asked the MBCC for assistance, claiming that she found a batch of Mania waste products that could not be handled. Although the incident did not cause any casualties or financial losses, the subject was still detained by the Chief of the MBCC.","arrestRec2":"After the MBCC took over the project to establish Syndicate Academy, the subject worked hard to recruit students and compile textbooks. However, she was dissatisfied with the history of Syndicate as described by Eastside and hoped to rewrite it.","arrestRec3":"The subject was deployed in operations alongside Rustfire in N.F. 103 and returned to Eastside in the same year to rpmote Rustfire's achievements. However, because her reports could prove detrimental to the fundamental interests of the Nirvana Group, she was captured by Nirvana's secret department called DRD and later suffered inhumane retaliation afterward.","arrestRec4":"The subject is currently an instructor at Syndicate Academy, primarily responsible for teaching the Dis language and poetry. According to her, the faculty team at the school now has 15 people, and the number of students has also reached 136. If all goes well, the school plans to continue expanding.","servingTerm1":"The subject has an eccentric personality. She usually behaves in a bizarre but casual manner, making exaggerated body movements and facial expressions. She is also exceptionally enthusiastic towards children. When she was first detained, some of the younger and more introverted Sinners were spooked by her and questioned her sanity.","servingTerm2":"Even while detained at the MBCC, the subject is constantly paying close attention to news about Syndicate, especially those pertaining to \"the Homeless\".","servingTerm3":"The subject filed a request to teach poetry appreciation and analysis to the young Sinners in the Bureau. However, the application was rejected, as the Bureau thought it would be more appropriate to start with teaching basic literacy and language skills.","servingTerm4":"The subject's poetry skills are actually not that good, but she especially relishes composing tacky odes for Chief. Since coming to the MBCC, her odes have filled an entire notebook, and she is looking for the right time to recite them all in one go to Chief in front of everyone at the Bureau.","emotionCheck1":"[Raven looks at you with interest]\n\n**Raven:** You want me to write a press release?

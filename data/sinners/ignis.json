During the arrest, the subject burned down three street blocks, injuring many people and causing massive property damage.\n\nEscaped from the detainment during a riot, but turned herself in after staying briefly in Eastside for unknown reasons. The subject is suspected to pose a safety threat.\n\n--\n\nProper public awareness of Sinners had not yet been formed when the incident happened, which resulted in severe emotional repression in the subject during her formative years. The lack of specialized Sinner detention and training institutions at the time also led to the outburst of the Sinner's special power after she was harassed, which in turn resulted in the accident.\n\nThe retrieved MBCC records reveal that the subject was ushered out by the crowd during the riot and did not escape on her own account.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nAble to make any substance within a ten-meter radius combust instantly.

Ignis believes there's no reason to talk about it claiming that she's the culprit. The Chief isn't convinced, but Ignis is become agitated over their inquiries. So, the Chief changes their approach to break the ice, and in turn revealing that they know that Ignis has a food blog. While Ignis gets angry enough to cause a combustion she apologizes as if it were an accident. This small outburst confirms the Chief's suspicion that Ignis loses control of her ability when her emotions are high. Ignis reveals that writing her blog is what gave away her Sinner identity and she blames herself. After reassuring her the Chief asks with hesitation if two people who went missing that day were her parents. Ignis gets furious and nearly loses control, but that doesn't stop the Chief's suspicions.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Your interrogation is successful. From the information, you learned that there is another criminal case where Ignis is involved, and that is the serial arsonist of Eastside. Since then, she hasn't demonstrated any viscous behaviors.

She had attempted to cook likely from hunger, so the Chief offers to help her prepare a steak. The Chief figures out that Ignis worked at her parent's restaurant, but often doesn't cook because fire makes her own fire go out of control. Ignis becomes cautious as Chief asks again about her parents wanting get to know more about her. Ignis reveals that she gave herself up to the FAC under the condition that her family stay unimplicated so they aren't known for raising a Sinner. A sacrifice in a way since they sacrificed so much for her upending their own lives to better accommodate her. They were relatively happy, Ignis even feeling normal as she went about life with her family and writing her blog. While Ignis blames herself for ruining everything the Chief reassures her that her parents picked themselves back up. Ignis knows all these details including that they have new daughter, a normal one unlike her. Ignis wants to let them be, so they can have normal life, and while she sheds no tears they only seem be held back.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>She came here of her own accord and became what others called a monster. It is for herself but also for her parents.\r\n\r\nIt's like a recovering wound.

While Ignis is terrified at the vicinity she's in of her family and angry at the Chief she doesn't want to leave. Ignis becomes placid as she looks on at her family's restaurant. The Chief orders two creme brulee getting Ignis to recall a story of her burning down garage trying to make the same dish somehow getting a burned one that survived it and earning the nickname Fire-kissed Creme Brulee. With sudden happenstance The Chief reveals that the creme brulee they ordered spells out Ignis. Ignis breaks out into quiet sobs knowing fully well that this dish, Ignis's Kiss, was a quiet letter to her that they never forgot her. After finishing up and being reminded by Nightingale that it was time Ignis timidly asks if they could come back.

To help cover up the subject's Sinner identity, her parents even gave up their careers and relocated several times.","arrestRec3":"Since the subject has zero gift for cooking, her parents encouraged her to nurture a food reviewing hobby after school. She's set up a food review social media account named //Crème Brûlée Official// and has gained a substantial following. The blog is currently on hiatus.","arrestRec4":"Some rude fans once tried to probe the subject's personal information and managed to find her location and trespassed into her home. This behavior directly caused an emotional breakdown in the subject which resulted in a fire.","servingTerm1":"The fireproof room the MBCC's specifically prepared for her has made her the center of attention among all the Sinners. She's even gained a new nickname //Apple Peel// because of her unique hairstyle.

It's been a while. Today, I'm bringing you a special review...\n\n**Ignis:** A review of the food in the Minos Bureau of Crisis Control!\n\n**Ignis:** What do the Sinners eat every day? Is it different from food outside?\n\n**Ignis:** We'll begin with today's lunch. Let's have a taste of it.\n\n**Ignis:** First, the mashed potato on the side. The cook was obviously trying to give it a refreshing texture by mixing in an equal portion of blended steamed spinach. This helps lighten the mashed potato's overly sticky texture before and makes the taste more pleasant.\n\n**Ignis:** Next, we have the main dish, a steak. Due to reasons we all know, steaks in the Bureau have always had an unsatisfactory texture and freshness. But the cook made a bold decision to make the steak well done and neutralized the dryness and bitterness with a sweet-and-sour sauce, which was a thoughtful approach.\n\n**Ignis:** Last, the salad. Limited by ingredients, its composition and seasoning are the same as before. However, it seems that the kitchen has switched to a better supplier, since the freshness of the vegetables and fruits is now a notch higher. The salad finally has the crispiness and freshness it ought to have.\n\n**Ignis:** All in all, the Bureau's food rating has gone from a previously failing score to above D+ now. Given the kitchen's current condition, it's a huge leap forward.\n\n* **Prompt:** It makes me hungry.\n\n**System Notifications:** Having read Ignis's review, the food before you seems tastier now.","supervision6":"++* ⚠⚠⚠ Someone Who Gets It\n\n//Ignis asks you about the new cook in the Bureau.//\n\n**System Notifications:** Ignis chats with you about the new cook in the Bureau.\n\n**Ignis:** Chief, has the Bureau hired a new cook recently?\n\n* **Prompt:** Express surprise\n\n**Chief:** You can even tell that from the taste?\n\n**Ignis:** Yes. The new cook prefers a lighter taste and purposely puts less seasoning in the food.\n\n**Ignis:** Also, the new cook likes to show their personal style, so sometimes they don't strictly follow the recipes.\n\n**Ignis:** But every Monday, their cooking quality dips slightly. I'm not sure why.\n\n**Ignis:** Perhaps the cook really hates Mondays.\n\n* **Prompt:** Express confusion\n * **Chief:** I thought you hated the Bureau's cafeteria.\n * **Ignis:** Not really. Of course, food in the Bureau is lacking in many aspects, but I'm not gonna blame the cooks for that.\n * **Ignis:** After all, a real food critic only focuses on critiquing the food itself.\n * **Ignis:** Besides, this cook is already doing their best under this very limited condition. I've even written a review about that. Have you not read it yet, Chief?\n\n* **Prompt:** Arrange a meeting\n * **System Notifications:** You tell her you can arrange for the two of them to meet. The cook has already read the food reviews Ignis published on the Intranet and has been singing praises.\n * **Ignis:** W-what?!\n * **Ignis:** I don't think that's necessary. A food critic doesn't always have to meet the food's creator.\n * **Ignis:** Right, to keep my reviews impartial, I'd better not have a personal relationship with the cook.","baseVoicelines":"[Obtain the Sinner]\nAn arsonist stands before you.

She has harassed over a hundred individuals with her powers during the night, giving rise to the rumors of late-night electroshock attacks. The subject's method is very similar to that in the case of a director's death by electrocution several years ago. More details are to be investigated.\n\n--\n\nInterrogation reveals that the subject possesses another personality which arose due to the traumatic encounters she had earlier in her life. The said personality is righteous but brutal, and will //punish// alleged sexual harassers with the subject's special power.\n\nInterrogation also uncovers that she indeed caused the injury of a director whom she worked with a few years ago. But being in a life-threatening situation at the time, she only activated her power for self-defense. After a period of discipline and supervision, the subject has promised to never abuse her power again.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThe subject's power is an electrical release but with varying voltage, ranging from causing pain to incinerating the victim. This ability has the potential for precise control, which the subject has not yet mastered.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nAccording to Luvia, she suffered from dissociative identity disorder even before awakening. The first power release was during abduction of Luvia, the main personality, under the encouragement of Ray.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nA patient suffering from severe disasociative identity disorder with two personalities — \"Luvia\" and \"Ray\". The examination results showed that this was her psychological symptom unrelated to mutation. Currently at a stable incubation period.\r\n","ecbFlavourText":"\"This time, it's my turn to protect you.\"","interrogation1":"Thanks to Chameleon's diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder, the Chief quickly intuits the difference between the Luvia Ray's two personalities, arguing with Ray, the more aggressive of the two, about the circumstances of her arrest. The Luvia personality, the softer of the two, is an aspiring actress. She received a suspicious invitation to an unnamed audition, which she attended despite Ray's disapproval and ended in Ray forced to fend off her attackers with her electrical ability. The Chief explains that Ray disrupted a joint operation between the MBCC and the FAC: an attempt to arrest the \"crew\" behind the audition, a group suspected of trafficking multiple teenage girls. In the chaos of Ray's attack, their leader -- the supposed Director -- managed to escape, and the Chief suspects that Ray may have intentionally hindered their investigation. Ray instead bemoans Luvia's naivety and career choice, saying that she only wanted to protect Luvia from being kidnapped, and never addresses the Chief's concerns.\n\nPartway through, the Luvia personality forcibly assumes control. She explains that while Ray inherits all of her memories, she doesn't inherit all of Ray's, contrary to the usual clinical example of the \"dominant\" personality possessing the majority of memories. Despite all of the warning signs, and even after being detained, Luvia seems completely oblivious to what almost happened to her; she is more upset with the fact that Ray doesn't support her dreams. The Chief suggests that Ray is trying to protect her. Luvia admits that she knows this, but it still doesn't change her feelings on the matter.\n\nAfter deciding that Ray is the more useful of the two personalities for the investigation, the Chief hatches a plan. They will attend another of the suspicious auditions as Luvia's agent, and Luvia, overjoyed, seems oblivious to the Chief's intent in using her as cover for a follow-up operation. Despite allowing a moment in the offer for Ray to interject, she remains silent, and the Chief wonders whether Ray will prove useful or is simply overconfident in her abilities.\n\n<p style=\"color: white\"><i>Luvia Ray's dual personality has been confirmed. You decided to use this as leverage to infiltrate the illegal shooting location once again. There is an information asymmetry between Luvia Ray's two personalities. Strangely enough, the one with more information isn't the dominating personality. You believe there is a way to get to the bottom of this. </i></p>","interrogation2":"The Chief and Luvia arrive at the same location as her prior audition. The Chief muses internally that their target must be extremely confident to not already have abandoned it. Despite being led by suspicious men into a suspicious room, Luvia once again seems oblivious, still excited about the possibility of obtaining a leading role. While they wait, the Chief asks Luvia about her past with Ray. Luvia shares a few stories from before she knew about Ray's existence, when she would wake from dissociative episodes to find her various attempts at auditions foiled. Although never able to get a straight answer out of Ray for her behavior, she discusses her other half with fondness and expresses regrets at being constantly at odds with her. In stark contrast to Luvia's high spirits, the Chief is concerned that her involved relationship with Ray is indicative of the fact that her Mania is worsening at an alarming rate. The two are eventually led to the room with the Director, and Luvia gives him an extremely mediocre performance. Even the faux Director comments on Luvia's poor acting skills, but still has his two henchmen lead them to a \"lounge\" on account of Luvia's appearance. Luvia and the Chief are led deeper into the building, causing even Luvia to become nervous, and the henchmen soon confirm her suspicions by knocking the two unconscious.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chief awakens in a cramped room with a single small window, Ray is in control, noting that their captors are aware of her identity by the fact that her hands are tied with rubber cords. While the Chief bites through her restraints and assures her that Nightingale has received their distress signal, Luvia surveys the area. Through the small window, she recognizes the Director walking down the hall, immediately growing intensely anxious. As they overhear the Director beating another kidnapping victim, Ray slips and falls into a previously unseen bathtub, gripped by flashbacks of being tortured and filmed. Watching her be overcome by the acute trauma of her previous experience in this very room, the Chief, hands still tied, can only shackle Ray in an attempt to calm her. As Ray fades from consciousness, she refers to herself as \"Luvia's hero in the mirror,\" apologizing for not being able to protect her this time.\n\n<p style=\"color: white\"><i>As you expected, the director blew the cover and locked you and Luvia Ray in a small chamber. After seeing the \"director's\" true colors and the tragedy befalling the girl, Ray is acting strange.</i></p>","interrogation3":"As Luvia resumes control, the Chief sees a flash of her memories: a previous encounter with others who kidnapped and tortured her, Ray declaring that she wouldn't let them \"touch even her finger.\" Now awake, she is burdened with the memories that Ray withheld from her, now realizing why Ray didn't want her to become an actor. Distraught over her own inability to help her other self, the Chief reassures her by saying that in her memories, Ray reached out to Luvia for help in her darkest moments, saying that they are each others' heroes. With further encouragement, Luvia stands, emboldened, and quickly harnesses the Sinner abilities that she previously had no control over, blasting a hole in the wall to allow for their escape.\r\n\r\nWith renewed vigor, Luvia accepts the Chief's next offer: to be a hero for those who have suffered like her. Together, they free the other girls, with Luvia electrocuting all of their captors one by one, until they come to face to face with the Director. Though initially shaken, Luvia rallies, preventing him from calling for help but unable to bring herself to kill him. Enhanced by Mania crystals, the Director rushes the Chief, but Luvia, echoing Ray's declaration of \"I won't let you touch even their finger,\" blasts him with powerful electricity, assuring him that death would be too easy an end for someone like him. In that moment, Ray praises Luvia in their shared mind, revealing that it was Luvia who used their powers to help them first escape, not Ray -- Ray simply took on the memories so Luvia wouldn't be weighed down by them.\r\n\r\nSome time later, back at the Bureau, Luvia has begun regular training to learn to properly wield her abilities. The Chief has made a deal to allow her to continue pursuing her acting career as long as all her filming can be done under the MBCC's supervision. Ray and Luvia can now co-inhabit their body together, and the Chief watches as the two bicker over Luvia's supporting role in her current film.\n\n<p style=\"color: white\"><i>The conflict between Luvia and Ray is getting worse by the day, but this is actually because both of them want to protect each other. They are each other's heroes.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"During the investigation of the \"Eastside serial electrocution case,\" she was caught after committing the crime of being in the street late at night, who switched from being agitated to gentle.

Please investigate promptly.\n\n* **Prompt:** Ask Tetra\n\n**Chief:** Do you have any leads on this?\n\n**Tetra:** As soon as you hear something's missing, you come straight to me. You really have a lot of \"trust\" in me, Chief.\n\n**Tetra:** Tell me, what are you looking for?\n\n* **Prompt:** Check the lost items list\n\n**Chief:** Four boxes of cream, six jars of large candies, ten sets of stationery...\n\n**Tetra:** Hmm... Doesn't ring a bell. I've handled countless treasures, these little trinkets are far from memorable to me.\n\n**Chief:** ...And twelve rabbit plush.\n\n**Tetra:** Hmm... Wait, are you talking about that \"Robber Rabbit\" thing?\n\n**Chief:** You remember now?\n\n**Tetra:** Maybe. It's not every day you see a plush that fails so miserably at portraying the cool and cute bunny.\n\n**Tetra:** I've gotten rid of them for you. You're welcome.\n\n* **Prompt:** Demand her to return them\n * **Chief:** The event is about to start. You must return these prizes.\n * **Tetra:** I'm not lying, Chief, I really don't remember much.\n * **Tetra:** If you want to find these tacky things, you'll need to show off your excellent deductive abilities, Chief.\n * **Chief:** I'd rather spend that time on important matters.\n\n* **Prompt:** Demand compensation\n * **Chief:** You need to compensate for the missing prizes.\n * **Tetra:** If you mean that you need me to replace those gifts, of course I can. I can guarantee that the \"prizes\" I bring out will be more popular than those trinkets.\n * **Chief:** It's a shame that I can't make sure the prizes you provide in such a short period of time are obtained \"normally\".\n * **Tetra:** Sure, you can do that. You're the Chief of the MBCC, after all. But, if the logistics department doesn't learn their lesson, I can't guarantee that the items won't \"disappear\" again."}

Chameleon fires back, claiming that there is no difference between her hypnosis and the Chief's use of the [[[Shackles]]] on unwilling Sinners. While Chameleon distracts them from the main topic of the interrogation, they become disoriented by the sounds of her pocket watch. After fifteen minutes that pass faster than expected, [[[Nightingale]]] pulls the Chief out of the Interrogation Room.\n\nWandering the halls of the Bureau later, the Chief hallucinates visions of many different Sinners, who accuse them of treating Sinners like dogs or slaves and prying into their painful memories, causing pain just because of their curiosity about the Sinners' pasts. Eventually, the Chief realizes that they are having a nightmare, and reawakens in the Interrogation Room.\n\nThe Chief Shackles Chameleon, but she shows no fear or hesitation. The Chief then ends the interrogation, ordering Nightingale to put her into solitary confinement under heavy guard and confiscate her pocket watch. Her parting words are that although she and the Chief are the same in causing pain, in these chaotic times, pain may not be a bad thing.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Chameleon didn't directly answer any of the questions regarding the case. Instead, she tried to hypnotize you without your consent in an attempt to break your determination by making you believe that the other Sinners are refusing to cooperate.\nHer mysterious nature troubles you. It seems another threat is lurking in the dark and waiting for its chance to jump at you.</i></p>","interrogation2":"The Chief has confused dreams featuring fire, blood, a clock, and a crying girl. When they awake, they instinctively seek out Chameleon, who explains that it was her dream, which the Chief entered somehow via the Shackles' link. She goes on to tell them that as a child, she would hide inside her father's clock cabinet to watch them consult their patients. From this position, she witnessed her parents' murder at the hands of a patient who did not trust that they would keep his secrets. He bashed their heads in with a sculpture of Hypnos, the God of Dreams, and set fire to the office to destroy their records.\n\nIn order to learn what else the Chief saw in their dream, Chameleon hypnotizes them again, having been faking vulnerability in order to lure the Chief into her trap. The Chief's subconscious world takes the form of an archive, where they see a vision of a shadowly [[[Langley]]], who feels familiar but unrecognizable. At Chameleon's urging, the Chief asks Langley for the whereabouts of a hostage that they had seen in their earlier dream. Langley hands them a document detailing Chameleon's family history and the murder of her parents at the hands of Oris, a self-made man who began as the secretary to a councilor, before marrying into the Jacknal family and becoming a councilor of Paradeisos himself. Ten years after the murders, in N.F. 106, Oris's wife and parents cut ties with him; without the support of his wife's family, he lost his residency in Paradeisos. In N.F. 107, Oris was found hypnotized in Chameleon's private clinic by the 9th Agency, which went on to hire her as a special psychology consultant. Ultimately, Chameleon was arrested on suspicion of having tampered with the Jacknal family's subconsciouses after they experienced auditory hallucinations that are sequela to hypnosis. Most importantly for her purposes, the dossier also details that since his discovery, the 9th Agency has held Oris hostage at an old agency depot on the border of [[[Eastside]]] and [[[the Rust]]].\n\nWhen Chameleon receives this information, her voice disappears from the Chief's subconscious world. Struggling to escape the dream, the Chief recalls a suppressed memory: while hypnotized the first time, Chameleon implanted in them the urge to go to the 9th Agency's archives and investigate Oris's whereabouts, then forget having done it so that only she could recover the memory from their subconscious. When the Chief awakens from the dream, Chameleon has escaped. The Chief realizes that even with her pocket watch confiscated, Chameleon was still able to use her gold-rimmed glasses as a backup hypnosis prop.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Chameleon's power isn't just any hypnosis. She plants a subconscious thought in your mind that makes you want to check confidential documents, directly manipulating your behaviors and leading you to provide information to her without you realizing it.\nTo retrieve Oris, the culprit who killed her family, from the 9th Agency, she is resorting to every possible measure. But the enemy that she has been fighting isn't you but the woman hiding in the dark. Having fallen victim to the hypnotist and become the pawn in her hands several times, you decide to never let this happen again.</i></p>","interrogation3":"At the agency depot where Oris is being held hostage, the Chief meets with Chameleon one on one while an MBCC special operations team waits outside, ready to breach the building. Chameleon has tied Oris to a chair and left him in a semi-conscious state. Chameleon reveals that the secret which he murdered her parents to protect was infidelity, as he feared losing the protection of his then-fiancée's family. Having already taken away his wife, status and power with her machinations, Chameleon denies having done enough, saying that she has only made the people around him see who he really is -- she has not yet actually punished him at all. She says that she has not killed him nor run away because she wants an audience as she creates a tailor-made nightmare for him of an endless sea of fire and countless sharp blades. When the Chief expresses their shock at the torture, Chameleon is surprised that Langley did not tell him in the dream: despite all her credentials, the 9th Agency would not allow her near Oris because she is a psychopath who thrives on others' pain. The Chief attempts to end the torture by unleashing the Shackles, but the power fails to activate. The Chief believes that they are unresponsive because of previous subconscious impulses planted by Chameleon, but she reveals that from the second the Chief and their team approached the depot, all of them have once again been tricked into an illusory dream. The Chief fights through the hypnosis to draw a pistol given to them by Nightingale before they entered the depot.\n\nIf they shoot at Chameleon, they hit her in the leg and break her concentration enough for the Chief to use the Shackles and force her to end Oris's nightmare. Despite this defeat, Chameleon is ecstatic to learn that, contrary to her belief, the Shackles can connect to the spiritual world. The Chief orders her to surrender, saying they don't want to hurt her any further, but Chameleon correctly denies this, saying that when they fired the gun, they had the intent to kill. Nightingale and the MBCC team enter the building, and the Chief orders her to return Oris to the 9th Agency and never report where he will be hidden. Chameleon says that although the Chief denies it, they wish that she would have killed the hostage, and that like with her the seeds of evil have been planted in their mind.\n\nIf they shoot at themself, the pain from their leg wound snaps them awake enough to use the Shackles and force her to end Oris's nightmare. Defeated, Chameleon is incredulous that they would use such a method and says that they are no longer the novice who could be controlled so easily. Nightingale and the MBCC team enter the building and handcuff her. The Chief says Oris will be sent back to the 9th Agency and kept in a place that they will never know about, but Chameleon interrupts them, admitting her loss but saying that she already has a better toy to play with.\n\nChameleon is brought back to the Bureau and placed under S-class surveillance. In the time since then, she has returned to playing the role of a psychologist and hasn't mentioned anything about Oris or her own psychopathy. Nevertheless, the Chief uneasily feels that their conflict with her has only just begun.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Oris is now a hostage secretly taken into custody by the 9th Agency. And Chameleon is cooperating with the MBCC to continue the detention. Perhaps it is just like what Chameleon said: this is a balancing act of restraint. But it is also acceptable if we continue this balance. Greed, desire, and pain... The seemingly cool-headed psychologist is actually struggling to hold down the impulses deep down. You only have one mission: maintain balance and contain the subject.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"Voluntarily waited at the private psychiatric clinic and actively cooperated with the MBCC.

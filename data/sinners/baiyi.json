Currently, all three members of the company, Bai Yi, K.K., and Che, are stable and happy about their newfound life security and the fact that they don't need to exhaust themselves with work anymore.

She forces the Chief to download Whitestone Industries' app via a QR code on her chest and boasts about the company's capabilities, but is forced by K.K.'s contradicting testimony to admit that she is a liar and the company is in dire straits. When questioned about Zoya's whereabouts and her activities during BR-004, Bai Yi feigns ignorance. However, the Chief's questions about a man claiming to work for Whitestone Industries when apprehended for smuggling [[[Mania]]] weapons causes her to fly into a rage and promise revenge against anyone posing as a member of her company. She convinces the Chief to team up with her to achieve their mutual goal of punishing the impostors and stopping the smuggling of Mania weapons.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nBai Yi is very sly. She has not given you much useful info.

After some short planning, you decide to go back to save K.K. and Che.</i></p>","interrogation3":"Despite still being badly ill, Bai Yi and the Chief sneak back into the fake Whitestone through the ventilation ducts. She breaks into Boss Bai office to vomit and knocks him out. Upon realizing that he is the one impersonating her, Bai Yi beats and threatens him, interrogating him about the whereabouts of her subordinates. She and the Boss uncover that after losing his business in [[[Eastside]]], \"Boss Bai\" was paid by a mysterious individual to come to Syndicate and establish a Mania weapon smuggling operation, under the one condition that it go by the name of Whitestone Industries.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nYou made it. You and the Whitestone Industries team are all safe. But are things really what they seem to be? Probably not.</i></p>","interrogation4":"The Chief ponders who would have set up the fake Whitestone as a trap for Bai Yi, and why. They say that her one flaw as an actor is being too eager to prove that she is a harmless good-for-nothing, and resolves to play along until the time comes to expose her for who she is. To this end, the MBCC attempts to capture [[[List of Minor Characters |Rhett Bai]]] as he flees back to Eastside. They find him unconscious and restrained after his room was clearly broken into. \"Boss Bai\" had been attempting to make a tell-all video when he was assaulted, though the recording does not show his attacker, the speed of their movements and the sound of blades heavily imply that it was Bai Yi, covering up whatever circumstances led Rhett Bai to Syndicate.\n\nThe Chief follows the trail of blood from Rhett's window, but Bai Yi's voice is heard in the darkness, saying that she admires their bravery, but bravery alone is not enough. She claims to be protecting dangerous secrets, which will bring everything the Chief values under threat if they are ever learned. She says that the Chief eventually will have to know, but not now, and that they should go home and enjoy the rest of their peaceful days.\n\nBack at the Bureau, Bai Yi is failing to make money by convincing other Sinners to scan her QR code -- with K.K. injured, she needs to work, but [[[Hella]]] says that everybody knows that her app forced the Chief to get a new terminal. Bai Yi tells the Chief that she and Che are keeping things from K.K. because they don't want her to be dragged into their mess. She admits to having been at Keylan Square during BR-004, but refuses to tell the Chief Zoya's whereabouts.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nNo matter what the real identity of Bai Yi, no matter what she's been hiding, you will find out the truth.\nHoweer, it's really not time yet...

Later, a surveillance check suggested that this person showed signs of possessing Sinner power, and the subject was arrested after confirmation.","arrestRec2":"The database denied the MBCC's request to access the subject's early records, and the subject is unwilling to provide relevant information. There has been no progress on the investigation of the subject's childhood and family background.","arrestRec3":"With limited access to the subject's records, it's currently only known that before settling in Syndicate, the subject apparently changed identities frequently to evade an unknown power hunting her down. After settling down in Syndicate, the subject started running //Whitestone Industries// with Che and K.K., taking the role of the company's owner. The company has since been on the verge of bankruptcy multiple times.","arrestRec4":"The subject hides her past and her true levels of power under her playful and frivolous appearance. Her real identity, and the mysterious individuals hunting her down when she's after the fake Whitestone Industries require further investigations.","servingTerm1":"In stark contrast to her appalling power, the subject is unenthusiastic about all basic job duties and assigned missions and completely lacks the concept of time. There has been no improvement even after repeated warnings.","servingTerm2":"Having taken miscellaneous jobs like hired thug, delivery worker, and missing person searcher in the past, the subject is very willing to share her seasoned work experience with other Sinners. But as the subject's sharing often reflects questionable personal values, these chats have been interrupted by staff many times.","servingTerm3":"Skilled at making her own drinks with various grains and unknown ingredients, but never sells them and only shares them with other Sinners within a certain range. Among them, a drink named //Moonlight Baby// has received many praises and won the subject quite a few friends in the Bureau.","servingTerm4":"Have made several attempts to sell //Whitestone Industries//'s shares to people around her, but in vain.

She notices them and urges them to go away, saying that the place is not safe and that she needs to go save Che and K.K.'s lives. An announcement from a loudspeaker threatens her to come face her death, or else allow her friends to die. She is more serious and uncomfortable than the Chief has ever seen her, so they follow her.\n\nChe and K.K. are unconscious and breathing shallowly. A shadow appears and mocks Bai Yi's anger, saying that it is surprised that after she has betrayed so many companions, Bai Yi can still say that she cherishes the two of them. It tells her never to dream of getting rid of her past. The Chief stops her from rushing forward into the countless shadows before them. Bai Yi agrees to follow the Chief's plan, but insists that if it fails, she will do anything it takes to rescue them -- even if that means they all die together.\n\nThe monsters in the maze scream Bai Yi's name and chant \"Sacrifice!\" One is torn apart, and the other feast on its body.\n\nA monster with a sewn-on human face attempts to kill Che with an axe, accusing Bai Yi of having done something similar in the past. Che has been tortured to the point that he can't move an inch.\n\nA monster, seeing Bai Yi, calls out in fear for help, only to be swiftly silenced by her blade. She says that their kindness is merely a trick. Another monster covered in scars also seems afraid, threatening to shoot K.K. if Bai Yi approaches. It says that killing the traitor Bai Yi would avenge its friends' deaths and changes focus to her, giving her an opening to kill it. K.K. is tied to an electric chair, barely breathing.\n\nThe final monster guarding the exit of the mirage manages to cut Bai Yi's wrist with its longsword. The monster is surprised to see her, believing her to be long dead. Together, Bai Yi and the Chief kill the monster.\n\nOutside the mirage, the Chief is drinking with the three Whitestone employees, having spaced out for a few minutes. Seeing the three of them having a good time puts the Chief at a loss for words. They remark that they wonder which is the real Bai Yi, but the others dismiss the question. Recalling the last monster's words, the Chief wonders if technology that can resurrect the dead exists in the DisCity. Bai Yi laughs and changes the subject, forcing the Chief to drink more. Drunk, they eventually pass out, but not before noticing a scar on Bai Yi's wrist.\n\n//Specks of light flicker in the long, dark night. \"It's not bad to do this every once in a while.\" She sips her beer and gazes out the window.//","baseVoicelines":"[Obtain the Sinner]\nAlright, alright.

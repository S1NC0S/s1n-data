She vanished without a trace following a hideous \"accident\". She was rumored to be the cause of the \"accident\", and later earned the nickname Eastside Cyclops.\n\n--\n\nAfter a series of investigation and interrogation, it's found that the subject has been constantly bullied and isolated due to her background and timidity. Her power awakened and went out of control as she tried to exercise self-defense but not intentional harm. None of the students injured during the Eastside school incident was fatally harmed and all of them have since been discharged from the hospital.\n\nBesides, under Chief's encouragement and mediation, the subject has gradually come out of the mental restraints her family has put on her and is determined to start a new life.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nLynn's eye releases energy blasts continuously, and she has no control over it.

The Chief knows that as Lynn's nickname and recognizes her fleeing from the scene in the video, and decides to bring her in for questioning. They can't believe that Lynn would intentionally hurt anybody, but want to get to the bottom of what really happened. In the interrogation room, Lynn is predictably extremely nervous and skittish. The Chief takes some time to calm her down by complimenting her accessories and craftiness before switching the topic to her helmet. Lynn insists that if she ever removes the helmet, something horrible will happen, but the Chief reassures her that they won't try to make her take it off. Still, they need to know what she's so afraid of so that they'll know how to help her. Lynn reluctantly agrees, and explains that her family were [[[syndicate |Syndican]]] immigrants to [[[Eastside]]]. For that, she was mercilessly teased by her classmates. This came to a head when she got a camera for her birthday, and fell in love with photography. Lynn talks about how her worries feel small when seen through the viewfinder, and how she loves to shoot the lively, energetic scenes of Syndicate and [[[Drifter Camp]]] more than the sterile cityscape of Eastside. Because of this she was bullied further, and ultimately forced to wear the helmet due to taunts about how her eyes must be bad if she liked such ugly subjects. Since then, she came to internalize their hate and only feels comfortable when wearing the helmet, fearing that she'll cause problems for others without it.\n\nThe Chief switches subjects to the Eastside School Incident, and reveals that the victims had all been bullies at their school. The Chief gently presses Lynn about whether she thinks they had it coming, and she immediately breaks down and cries that she didn't mean to hurt them. Lynn says that she didn't know what was happening either, and was as terrified as anybody else when beams began shooting from her eyes. The Chief tries to calm her down again, but Lynn is in the middle of a mental breakdown, calling herself a monster and unable to be reached. The Chief decides to give her a little time while they try to figure out how to help her.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>You learn from Lynn the difficult situation she faced at school. With some probing, you also confirm your supposition about the case. It's the result of a victim's self-defense gone out of control. But the exposure of the truth causes a mental breakdown in Lynn, so the interrogation comes to an abrupt end.\nYou must find a way to help her overcome the trauma.</i></p>","interrogation2":"The Chief surprises Lynn with a leave permit to take a photoshoot trip in Syndicate. Although she is initially hesitant, once they are outside Lynn quickly lets her excitement and passion shine through. She impresses the Chief with her knowledge of the area and her keen eye for overlooked details, although their compliments embarrass her. Lynn prefers to stay to the alleys, away from crowds, because she gets nervous about the attention that she draws. However, she lets slip that she has a friend in Syndicate who is willing to be her model. This friend turns out to be Yellow, a big dog who lives in Drifter Camp. After playing with and taking pictures of Yellow, Lynn says goodbye, seemingly for the last time -- and is surprised to hear that she is still allowed to come back as many times as she want. Flustered, Lynn expresses her gratitude to the Chief for giving her the chance to make these memories and making her feel like a normal person instead of a monster. \n\nAt this, the Chief suggests that Lynn could live like a normal person all the time if she was able to take off her helmet. Lynn freaks out about her inability to control her power, but the Chief does their best to convince her that the [[[Shackles]]] will keep her safe and prevent any accidents. At their urging, Lynn admits that she does want to live without her helmet. Nervously, she removes it and opens her eyes. No disaster occurs, and the two of them continue taking photos. Without her helmet, Lynn is able to go anywhere and joyously photographs even the crowds of people on the main streets of the city. Lynn wonders if she deserves to keep living like this after having hurt people, and the Chief reminds her that the life of fear and hiding she has lived since then was already punishment enough. It is the beginning of a new path for her to live with courage and confidence, and she expresses her hope that one day she'll be able to comfortably live as a normal girl.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Through Lynn's lens, you see a different Syndicate. You even meet her loyal friend Yellow. But all of this is still not enough to make her take off her helmet.\nSo you remove Lynn's power with the shackles to allow her to be a normal girl for a while, to let her know she has all the right to start over again. Finally, Lynn eats the candy of courage and tells you she'll try to pull herself together.</i></p>","interrogation3":"Lynn's parents unexpectedly arrive at the Bureau to visit her. Lynn misses them, but is nervous to see them with the way she is now. The Chief lets her decide whether to meet them or not, but reminds her that she promised to start over and that making her family understand her is an important part of that. Lynn agrees, but asks the Chief to be there with her. Her parents are relieved to see her, having had no idea where she was ever since she went missing after the Eastside School Incident. When her mother asks about her helmet, Lynn explains the fear that made her start wearing it as well as her determination now to move on with her life. They are sympathetic and hurt to see their daughter that way, but the conversation quickly takes a turn as it is revealed that they both blame Lynn for the accident that forced her to run away. Her parents see her as having wasted the effort that they put in to move from Syndicate to Eastside and pursue a better life, and they think that if Lynn had not antagonized the other kids, nothing would have happened. Lynn emotionally tries to explain the way that her bullies had treated her, and her pain moves her parents, but they persist in placing the responsibility on her. Having endured prejudice as Syndicans themselves, they believe that Lynn's only option should have been to tolerate the abuse. Ultimately, Lynn's father says that he wished they had never given her the camera that was the inciting cause of the conflict.\n\nThe Chief interrupts and scolds her parents for their actions, rebutting any attempts they make to justify their supposed powerlessness to help her. Encouraged by the Chief's help, Lynn confesses for the first time that she does not like Eastside. Despite supposedly being a glamorous and prosperous city, it has never offered her anything but pain. She says that she would rather give up on life in Eastside than continue to tolerate its prejudice. Finally, she suggests that if her parents can't accept her decision, she would want the [[[framework against catastrophe |FAC]]] to perform a memory intervention procedure. Her parents are horrified, but Lynn shows new determination and removes her helmet to show them the scar below her eye that was inflicted when her bullies attacked her. Seeing her face, her parents finally cave and regret their actions. They promise to also do their best to change like Lynn has, and the three of them hug as a family. The Chief says that they should maintain regular distance between normal people and a Sinner, but promises to notify them whenever Lynn is allowed out for a photoshoot so they can all meet each other again.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Lynn's parents love their daughter dearly, but in the wrong way. They kept teaching her to tolerate and indirectly caused the tragedy.\nFortunately, Lynn finally plucks up her courage and chooses to live her life the way she wants to. To get a chance to see their daughter again, her parents decide to make a change too.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"Lynn was found by OwO in the sewage system in the Blockbuster Films Incident and recruited by OwO as a cinematographer to her film crew. After the incident was resolved, Lynn was taken back to the MBCC, for safety reasons.","arrestRec2":"Lynn was born into an ordinary family in Eastside. Her parents were among the small cohort of Syndicans with a clean record who had come to Eastside legally after the passing of West District Order Management Regulations. Still, the family was ostracized by Eastside society because of their origins, and Lynn was a long-time sufferer of unfair treatment at school.","arrestRec3":"Lynn ran away in the wake of the Eastside School Incident. In her haste to put distance behind her, Lynn slipped and fell into a drainage ditch on a construction site. She gathered scrap from the ditch and assembled a helmet that could hem her power in. She has been wearing the helmet ever since while living in Eastside's sewage system, coming out only at night.","arrestRec4":"Lynn is mousy and withdrawn, avoiding human contact like the plague. A talented photographer who has never received any formal training, she takes great photographs simply by instinct. The skyscrapers in Eastside hold little appeal for her. What tickles her imagination as a photographer is the unorthodoxy of Drifter Camp, the ruggedness of the Syndican border, and the colorfulness of people's everyday life.","servingTerm1":"When Lynn was a newcomer to the MBCC, she put up a wall around her with her shyness. She never initiated a conversation, and when she was dragged into one, she averted her eyes throughout. Her awkwardness was most obvious when she was interacting with Sinners who were excessively friendly.","servingTerm2":"Lynn balks at the idea of engaging in battle, but she's dutiful and dedicated when it comes to non-combat tasks assigned by the MBCC, doing her utmost to complete as many tasks as possible and complete them as satisfactorily as possible.

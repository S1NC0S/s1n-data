She searches for specific targets using a novelty show as a cover and confines them, among other things, without any regard for consequences. This has caused a panic and greatly disrupted the order in Eastside.\n\nThe subject once took extreme measures to put the Chief of the MBCC in danger in their confrontation. Therefore, the subject is regarded by the FAC as a highly dangerous Sinner and must be detained immediately.\n\n--\n\nSince her detention, regular examinations have found that the subject's stress has reached a dangerous level. The finding can explain her various behaviors prior to her detention. To lower her insecurity and stabilize her mental state, the MBCC conducts desensitization therapy on her in the form of monitored physical contact with other Sinners or Chief when her conditions allow it. So far, this has been effective and her various indicators have been kept within the normal range.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\n\r\nThe subject awakened her power after being infected with Mania and bitten by a snake.

I just want to be happy...\"\n","interrogation1":"10 days after the end of the Sleepwalker incident, the Chief captures Serpent after a half hearted ambush. The Chief lets Serpent awaken in the Interrogation Room, and while not wanting to be harsh, they are intent on finding the Bottle of Dreams that Serpent used to create Ambrosia. Serpent plays coy, claiming that the danger is gone since Marv has been eliminated, while the Chief says they are being cautious as Sinners usually are more dangerous when they let themselves get caught.\n\nThe Chief brings up evidence of Serpent's connection to two incidents: the \"Pet Snake Incident\", in which a family was devoured by their pet, and the mass murder of employees and guests of Phantom Entertainment. The Chief asserts that both incidents are evidence of Serpent's use of Ambrosia torture others.\n\nSerpent breaks down wondering why they continue to resist the happiness brought by Ambrosia, and the Chief says it's more an indulgence, an ignoring of pain, referencing the events of the Endless Carnival and [[[Hamel]]] as a similar set of events and not wanting the same for Serpent. Serpent goes back to the Chief's curiosity on why she allowed herself to be captured, her intent becoming very clear as she talks of wanting give Chief happiness. The Chief goes along with her asks wanting to take care of the problem at it's root. So, in the guise of a kiss Serpent bites Chief's fingertip sending them into a deep haze.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nSerpent told that to know the truth behind everything, you must enter the \"theater\" with her.\nShe kissed your fingertip and brought you together into the haziness to find happiness.</i></p>","interrogation2":"Serpent reveals her past, starting with her awakening as a Sinner as she's transported to Eastside as food for the snake that she's now bonded with. When she overhears that there's a chance for happiness in Eastside, she awakens as a Sinner and asks the person who ordered the snake to go with him, showcasing her powers over the snake who previously nearly killed her. There she became a popular performer, but after years of being mistreated by the man who owns her, she commands her snake to kill him and his entire family, as they refused to give her the happiness that she craved. Serpent is then signed on to Phantom Entertainment by an agent who promises that that life will bring her happiness. When she is jealously despised by the other performers and the clients, who call her a monster and still see her as a freakish novelty, Serpent again orchestrates their deaths. To the Chief's surprise, neither of these incidents involved Ambrosia, raising questions about its origin.\n\nInternalizing the insults calling her a monster, Serpent concludes that she should go where the other monsters are and discovers the existence of the [[[BR-002 |Endless Carnival]]]. To the Chief's horror, Serpent decides to return to the Rust and join them. As she continues her story, the Chief notices that the real Serpent is looking sickly, as something is draining away at her life force.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nSerpent experiences the girl's past with you together in the theater.\nYou've found that the two cases related to Serpent have nothing to do with Ambrosia, so when exactly Serpent first got Ambrosia is still a mystery.</i></p>","interrogation3":"Serpent is rejected despite how many times she tries to enter the Endless Carnival, as (unknown to her) Hamel's influence over the Black Ring causes it to reject any humans who approach. As she despairs being turned out from the only place she thought she had left to go, Marv appears at the Carnival gate and attempts to feed on her through his Ambrosia. However, Marv quickly turns on her, realizing that she has no happiness inside her for him to eat.\n\nEnraged, Serpent nearly kills Marv for this revelation, and he quickly submits to avoid death. He gives her his heart, which quickly transforms into the Bottle of Dreams, and tells her that she can use it produce Ambrosia. Serpent returns to Eastside and finds a desperate old woman being tormented by her cruel boss; she concludes that being a monster prevents her from having her own happiness, but that other humans might still be able to become happy. Thus, Serpent coerces the old woman into killing her employer, believing that it could make the woman happy even though the same actions never brought happiness to herself. When this fails to make her feel better, Serpent lets the woman drink from the Bottle of Dreams, immediately sending her into a joyful sleep. Finally having found a way to spread happiness, Serpent decides that this will be her goal from now on.\n\nWith the story over, the Chief returns to reality and finds that Serpent has nearly force fed them Ambrosia while they slept. Although they initially push her away, the Chief notices that Serpent appears near half-dead and resolves to help her. So at the behest of Serpent's statements saying they'd only find the way to help her, in her Realm of Dreams the Chief drinks the Ambrosia and enters her dream world.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nIt turns out that th Endless Carnival was where Serpent meet Marv. But to your surprise, Serpent has made Marv her servant.\nBut new mysteries have appeared: Where did Marv come from? Did it have anything to do with that eerie parade of monsters?\nYou don't have time for these questions now, though. Serpent's life force is near the limit, and you have to save her from being controlled by Marv and the Bottle of Dreams.</i></p>","interrogation4":"Inside Serpent's Realm of Dreams, the Chief finds that Serpent's obsession with happiness has allowed Marv's heart to latch onto her spirit like a parasite. As Chief races to save Serpent, her dream begins to shatter and reduce into a black sludge threatening to devour them both. Marv intends to consume Serpent, leaving her with nothing but her memories of pain. The Chief assures her that even if there's suffering in reality there's happiness to be found there too, citing their own happiness as the Sinners they've met since waking up.\n\nThe two are attacked by a shadow of Marv who's trying to reclaim the Bottle of Dreams. The Chief attempts to talk Serpent out of her cycle of doubt. The Chief grabs for her explaining that despite suffering from love, she can derive happiness and that they can find happiness together. Their words have deep effect on Serpent, who with her newfound will stabs a hole in her chest to let the Chief extract the Bottle of Dreams from her heart.\n\nThe Chief shattered the Bottle of Dreams, killing Marv and ending the danger. The discovery that Serpent did not create Marv with her power but rather just happened across him raises much more unanswered questions, but at least Serpent has been safely brought into the fold. While Serpent is a little rambunctious, she now has a new lease on life at the MBCC.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nThe only power that Bottle of Dreams has left, has attached to Serpent's heart, eating away and controlling Serpent, whose Realm of Dreams has shattered.\nYou acknowledge, accept, and embrace the sufferings of Serpent, and wish to find the true happiness that belongs to her, together, along the path of future full of perils. </i></p>","arrestRec1":"When the Chief is on a mission in Eastside, Serpent gets in the way of and tries to provoke the Chief. After the Chief has solved everything, Serpent owns up to the crimes she has committed, and voluntarily agrees to be detained, though it is not clear if she has an ulterior motive.","arrestRec2":"Serpent's origin is a mystery. She's registered as an orphan from Eastside by Phantom Entertainment. But further investigations show that she's closely linked to the Pet Snake Incident, the Disappearance of Phantom Entertainment Guests, and other strange cases.","arrestRec3":" A family of four from a villa neighborhood in Eastside has gone missing mysteriously. According to info on the internet and testimonies of the family's neighbors, the family kept a python as a pet, which was taken care of by a girl. The girl and the snake has also gone missing. Through a comparison of different resources of information, it's been confirmed that the girl is Sinner Serpent.","arrestRec4":"A recheck on all the information concerning Serpent turns up something bewildering about her, like where she attained the Bottle of Dream. The MBCC is convinced that some person or people put Serpent up to it, and decides to dig deeper into her background.","servingTerm1":"The MBCC tried to detain Serpent and her snake in separate places, but the snake becomes agitated and restless in its cage, posing a threat to the lives of the staffers.

But when the subject perceives sarcasm or threat in the interlocutor's remarks, she tends to overreact. Some staffers said they felt their lives were under threat, and only a few Sinners find the way Serpent reacts quite amusing.","servingTerm4":"Once, while talking with the Chief, the subject used her snake to bind her feet and the Chief's together to stop the Chief from leaving the room. When questioned, the subject claimed she just wanted a warmer to put under her blanket.","emotionCheck1":"[Serpent shakes the cup in her hand]\n<p>\n**Serpent:** Don't you want to taste it...

While Dolly was fighting [[[Corruptor| Corruptors]]] with her trademark bat, she suddenly broke free of the [[[Shackles]]] and attacked the Chief. An [[[Framework Against Catastrophe| FAC]]] survey report on Dolly's \"Berserk\" ability detailed that it only activates as part of her self-preservation instinct, and that during its activation, she is effectively unconscious and unaware of her surroundings. The report also states that over thirty trials, Dolly broke all of the testing equipment.\n\nDolly denies one aspect of the report: her ability doesn't activate when she feels threatened, it activates when she gets too emotional, insisting that what triggered them earlier that day was hearing the crowd in [[[Eastside]]] Stadium nearby. The Chief presents her with a news clipping, in which it states that Dolly, the first seed for the Fountons (not the 'Keons' as her bio claims), got into a fight with a member of the opposing team, the Highlanders. Supposedly, FAC stationed in the venue broke up the fight, after which Dolly was issued a lifetime ban. This appears to be the same incident referenced in her character profile, when she awakened to her Sinner abilities. Dolly claims instead that what awakened her abilities was her resisting the FAC, not her fight with the player. She says that during the game, after finding out she was a [[[Syndicate| Syndican]]], the FAC tried to detain her for being in violation of the [[[West District Order Management Regulations| West District Regulations]]]. Her abilities allowed her to escape arrest and return home.\n\nNoticing that Dolly brought her baseball bat into the interrogation room, now dented and split in two, the Chief asks if she often fights with it like she did that day. Dolly says, surprisingly, that she doesn't use it often, nor did she use it in the thirty tests in which she broke the equipment, preferring her fists on most occasions. She says cheerily that she still practices her swing each day, to which the Chief replies that the ban must be hard on her. Dolly, unphased, says that the ban is only on Dolly the Sinner, not Dolly the baseball player.\n\nRetrieving Dolly's bat from the corner, the Chief begins to theorize that the bat must be somehow responsible for Dolly going Manic. Dolly dismisses this, but the Chief continues that Dolly seems to reserve the bat for those she deems to be her \"strongest enemies.\" Dolly agrees but grows increasingly hostile, insisting that she's never once gone Manic in any of her daily batting practices. Emboldened, the Chief makes Dolly a bet: if she brings her bat on their next mission to the [[[The Rust| Rust]]] and doesn't go [[[Mania| Manic]]], she'll be allowed to rejoin the Professional League. Dolly agrees, overjoyed, only to then be immediately sentenced to the confinement cell for the days leading up to the mission as punishment for attacking the Chief. When the Chief refuses to let Dolly bring her bat with her, she becomes agitated. As the Chief leaves the room, they hear Dolly grinding her teeth.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nYou are certain that Dolly's case isn't just an accident. She could never break free of your Shackles if she simply lost control of her emotions.\nAll of the truth will be revealed at the Rust in three days.</i></p>","interrogation2":"The Chief recovers a despondent Dolly from the confinement cell, who immediately brightens upon being given her bat. The two head out to the Rust via car, shown to have self-driving capabilities, which the Chief is quickly forced to override when a Corruptor attacks them. To help escape, Dolly inputs a route into the car's satnav, taking them off a jump and over a gulch to safety. Dolly explains that such a route is exactly what she took to get over to Eastside from Syndicate, to bypass the lengthy paperwork required for proper immigration. Her priority was to prove to Eastsiders that Syndicans can also play great baseball, and she was willing to risk deportation to do so.\n\nSoon after, the two arrive at their destination, and Dolly confronts a horde of Corruptors with bat in hand. The Chief notices as Dolly's speed increases, so to does the strain she puts on the Shackles. Dolly tries to maintain consciousness while she fights, but once again her abilities get the better of her. She attacks the Chief, who barely manages to stop her after several activations of the Shackles. Confronted with the truth about her condition, Dolly is distraught, recalling then that she didn't awaken to her abilities on the diamond that day: it was on the way to Eastside, where she used her bat to take down a Corruptor that tried to get in her way. The Chief attempts to comfort Dolly, assuring her that they'll find a solution, and offers her the chance to rest as much as she needs in the mean time.\n\nBack in the car, the Chief begins to drive them home, and Dolly almost immediately falls asleep in the backseat. Then, a call comes in from Nightingale, informing the Chief that there's been a Corruptor attack at none other than Eastside Stadium. With the FAC too far away to intervene in time, she asks that the Chief and Dolly reroute to assist.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nYour theory is completely correct. Her emotions weren't the only reason that unleashed her power. That baseball bat played a more important role.\nAfter learning the truth, Dolly seems downed and spiritless because she can never play another baseball game ever again.</i></p>","interrogation3":"The Chief and Dolly arrive at the scene. Dolly, though initially hesitant, decides to help with the evacuation effort. After helping some people evacuate, she meets the manager of her old team, who curses her out for being from Syndicate and for costing him betting money due to her fight. At the Chief's encouragement, Dolly throws him towards the emergency exit, saying that he should appreciate that a Syndican saved his life.\n\nBeing back on the field leaves Dolly feeling a little conflicted, and the Chief apologizes that Dolly won't get to play here ever again. Nightingale calls to alert them of a large Corruptor presence digging up from below, and the Chief says that this may be Dolly's best chance to shine in Eastside Stadium. She steps up to the plate, easily dispatching the monster while seemingly not losing consciousness. Afterwards, Dolly feels fulfilled in having accomplished something here with her bat in the end, even if it wasn't the game of her dreams.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>\nAfter several years, Dolly is back in Eastside's baseball field. There's no one to cheer for her.\nBut she looks happy all the same.\nThat is because this isn't just a baseball field. It is also the arena where she belongs.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"After escaping from the MBCC riot and returning to Syndicate, the subject worked as a fighter in various gangs.

Since her special power consumes a lot of energy, the subject has a much bigger appetite than ordinary people. The entire right arm displays physical signs of mutation resembling those found in Corruptors.\r\n","ecbFlavourText":"\"So, this is sunshine...\"","interrogation1":"Shortly after their encounter while fleeing SALVA Hospital, Ninety-Nine turned herself in to the [[[Minos Bureau of Crisis Control |MBCC]]]. Muzzled and restrained, she is interrogated by The Chief about the [[[PARMA (organization) |Laboratory of Parma]]]. She attests that the researchers there would draw blood from her and inject her with substances, take her apart and reassemble her, and force her to fight opponents who she would almost invariably kill. The Chief asks her about Hella, and she says that Hella is the one who lit up her world and gave her freedom, and that she will always protect her -- surprising the Chief, as Hella had refused to talk about Ninety-Nine when they had asked her.\n\nAt this Ninety-Nine, previously calm, begins to heat up. She asks the Chief about the MBCC prison riot, and whether they know where Hella is. When they confirm that Hella was unable to escape during the riot and is still at the Bureau, the rising heat of her body becomes so intense that it breaks the restraints holding her down. The Chief realizes that she turned herself in only for the chance to get close to and kill them in order to free Hella. She attacks the Chief but is held back by the [[[Shackles]]]. Her Mania increases rapidly, threatening to kill her as well or turn her fully into a monster, but Ninety-Nine insists she doesn't care so long as Hella becomes free. [[[Nightingale]]] and the guards shoot her, but her boiling blood pushes the bullets out of her body. Her assault is stopped only by Hella's voice coming over the intercom, distracting her long enough for Nightingale to inject her with a powerful sedative.\n\nLater, Nightingale reports that Ninety-Nine's Mania has progressed so far that she is almost more Corruptor than human, to the point that the Shackles are not even capable of fully constraining her. If she fully transforms, the mental feedback through will cripple the Chief. In order to prevent that, the [[[Framework Against Catastrophe |FAC]]] intends to execute Ninety-Nine.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>It turns out Ninety-Nine surrendered for a reason, after all.\nDuring the interrogation, Ninety-Nine went manic unexpectedly, forcing the FAC to lock her in the most heavily guarded confinement room.</i></p>","interrogation2":"Ninety-Nine has been moved to S-Class security. The Chief has been attempting to use the Shackles to halt Ninety-Nine's mutation, but with little effect, so the FAC forbids them from continuing to connect with her by the Shackles. As a last-ditch effort, the Chief instead goes to Hella and brings her to Ninety-Nine's cell. They reminisce about their time together in PARMA's laboratory and their escape, the first time that Ninety-Nine had ever seen the sun. Hella promises that she can free Ninety-Nine again now, but Ninety-Nine says that if Hella really meant that, then she wouldn't have stopped her from killing the Chief in [[[Syndicate]]]. Ninety-Nine goes Manic again and attacks Hella, who has to be rescued by the Chief.\n\nThe FAC issues a transfer notice and takes Ninety-Nine away. Three days later, Hella flees while out of the Bureau on a mission, attempting to intercept the FAC vehicle bringing her to her execution. The Chief and [[[Nightingale]]] agree they must go to get her back -- if she breaks Ninety-Nine out in this condition, she'll be killed.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Your Shackles cannot prevent Ninety-Nine's corruption from mutating and it will affect your mind if you force it. Also, Hella and Ninety-Nine had a quarrel and parted ways. You couldn't do anything but watch as the FAC took Ninety-Nine into custody.","interrogation3":"When the Chief and Nightingale catch up with the transport vehicle, they find it destroyed and Hella lying in a pool of blood beneath Ninety-Nine. The FAC's bullets cannot harm her, and unleashing the Shackles fries the Chief's mind without having any restraining effect. Hella attempts to hold her back, and Ninety-Nine beats her savagely. Still, the Chief hears Ninety-Nine's voice through the Shackles, asking them to kill her and save Hella. They apologize for being too weak to save her, but ask if Ninety-Nine truly wants to die, or whether she wants to see the sun. She says that she wants to live, and the Chief unleashes the Shackles again. They evolve, bringing Ninety-Nine's Mania under control.\n\nTen days later, Ninety-Nine's infection remains stable and she shows no signs of going manic. She is still confined in her cell, but is not restrained like she was before. The FAC agrees to let her stay at the MBCC, but will check on her randomly and execute her if ever they find her out of control again. 85% of the Bureau's staff still believes that it is too dangerous to allow Hella and Ninety-Nine to be contained together, but the Chief insists that after both of them nearly died, allowing this is the least that they can do. Ninety-Nine thanks them for helping them control the monster inside her, and says that for the first time, she believes she can truly be free.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Your Shackles hold down Ninety-Nine. Her mind is a collapsing mess, which takes its toll on you and makes you extremely uncomfortable.\nBut Ninety-Nine's will to survive and your determnation to care for Sinners evolve the Shackles' ability and enable it to control Ninety-Nine's manic status.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"The subject used to work as a hired gun in Syndicate and made a series of assassination attempts targeting the Chief of the MBCC. The MBCC failed to capture the subject even after sacrificing a great deal. In the end, the subject turned herself in for some unknown reason.","arrestRec2":"The subject's early records have been purposely erased and are almost impossible to obtain, so both the subject's real name and origins are unknown. There are no social activity records for the early years of the subject.

Later, in hope of finding her best friend, the subject actively took part in all sorts of revenge missions in Syndicate targeting the power behind Parma.","servingTerm1":"Fighting alongside certain powerful Sinners seems to have induced a sense of self-preservation in her, as the subject has begun requesting more intense training.

Usually defined by her overwhelming strength, she seems now to be struggling to endure something. The Chief tries to reach out to her, but she tells them not to follow her. Countless monsters emerge from their surroundings and Ninety-Nine destroys them all, but their corpses transform into filthy, contaminated blood that pours into her body, causing her to tear at her own skin. The Chief throws themself in front of her sword to stop her, and she pleads for them to take her away from this battle.\n\nThe Chief sees the exit to the mirage blocked by two gates. Ninety-Nine explains that there are two mechanisms that must be destroyed for it to open. She has been watching, hoping to escape, but is unable to resist the urge to fight. They make their way towards the mechanisms, Ninety-Nine obliterating many more monsters and fanatical researchers along the way, though she becomes weaker with every combat. When one mechanism is destroyed, it reforms into a massive Mania-weapon sword. When the other is destroyed, it plays a lab recording of an experiment.\n\nNinety-Nine urges the Chief to get out alone if she should die, but they insist that they will get her out of there alive. They finally reach the exit, and they emerge into a rain-soaked desert. The rain washes away the blood and contamination from her body. The Chief asks what she will do now, and Ninety-Nine answers that she doesn’t know, but she doesn’t want to be the person she was inside there anymore.\n\n//She perches atop a mountain of bones and a sea of blood//\n//She drops the sword in her hand.//\n//And lets the rain wash away the blood.//\n//Embracing her scars, she escapes from her own abyss.//","baseVoicelines":"[Obtain the Sinner]\nYou... are the one who imprisoned us.

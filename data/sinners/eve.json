She turned all living creatures in the factory into toys out of personal motives and forced them to move.\n\nHer power affected many innocent passersby around the factory and nearly caused a greater disaster at the border of the Rust.\n\n--\n\nEve has cooperated with treatment and interrogation and volunteered all the details of her contact with the Underground.

Witnessing the death of someone important triggered a massive emotional shock and awakened her as a Sinner.\n\n+++* Corruption State\nHer physical disability was caused by a childhood traffic accident unrelated to Mania, but it felt her frail and with a low resistance to Mania.

Sleep, our dear Eve...\"\n\"You haven't woken up from your dream, and the fairy tale hasn't ended...\"","interrogation1":"Shortly after the fire at Buonanotte Toy Factory, Eve is found alive in the ruins. The [[[minos bureau of crisis control |MBCC’s]]] investigations reveal that her leg injuries were caused by a car accident when she was a child. A doctor performs a checkup on Eve and explains that [[[sinner |Sinnerss]]] bodies are so resilient as to easily be able to accommodate artificial body parts; he tells the Chief that Eve’s nerves should have long-since fused with her prosthetic legs and enabled her to walk. He concludes that Eve, quite simply, has no more will to live and thus no reason to stand up. Eve is shown to not be eating food or taking her medication, and it is mentioned that she has tried to take her life several times.\n\nIn order to try to break through to her, the Chief shows Eve the pieces of the toys that had been her pretend family, which had crowded around her to protect her during the fire. They mention some of their own regrets and Eve senses this, asking how Chief can still continue moving on in a world full of lies, and that she does not know what her motivation to live is. The Chief responds that “lies can one day turn into truths”; by accumulating more knowledge and strength, one day, people can have the power to change their life. As Eve ponders these words, Chief receives a call from [[[Nightingale]]], and has to head out to investigate fluctuations in [[[Mania]]] levels at the old site of [[[BR-004]]]; they tell Eve that they will be waiting for her answer. \n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The fire in the factory has been extinguished, and the incident seems to be over. You need to embark on a journey for new crises, and it’s time for Eve to make her choice.</i></p>","interrogation2":"Eve is moved to [[[SALVA Hospital]]] for treatment. She meets a group of boisterous patients: Francisco, a painter who draws stick figures, Rhona, a child who makes nonsensical jokes, Andrew, the owner of a diner, Albert, a famous big eater. The nurse is cheerful and supportive of the other patients, but quietly tells Eve the truth that they are all admitted to the hospital for Mania contamination. Eve later says that they reminded her of some people she knew (her friends in the toy factory). Eve asks the nurse why she plays along with Francisco’s charade of being a great artist, and the nurse explains that when her arm was infected, the other nurses had told her she could be cured. Although she knew it was a lie and her arm was amputated, it somehow made it hurt less. An alarm rings, and the nurse dashes off.\n\nA flock of birds fly off in the distance, as if startled. Eve wonders what Chief is doing. (It is heavily implied that at this time, chaos has begun in [[[Drifter Camp]]]).\n\nLily, a little girl, speaks to Eve and asks the latter to fix her doll. Eve notices that the girl’s Mania contamination level is high, and that her contamination removal surgery is scheduled for within the week. She thinks about Chief’s words on turning lies into reality, and agrees to fix the doll. Elsewhere, the nurse is silent. Rhona has passed away, and other patients mourn her.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>One lie leads to another. They have no power to change the world, but they still hold hopes, tumbling forward in lies that will never come true.</i></p>\n","interrogation3":"Eve has started to keep a notebook of things to tell Chief. She writes that she lied to Lily, saying that the surgery was simple and not painful at all. Eve muses that she understands lies may not cure anything, but at least they bring some sweetness in dark times. Lily cheerfully tells Eve that she feels better after the surgery, showing off her new prosthetic. The doctor notes that Eve’s condition is improving, and concludes that she will be able to stand again.\n\nMore time passes, and Eve writes that huge riots have broken out in Syndicate (implied to be the Ten Days of [[[Rustfire]]]). Eve comforts Lily by telling her a story about a brave grey rag doll - the Chief. \n\nOne day, Francisco passes away after being hit by shrapnel from a Mania weapon that penetrated the hospital from the riots. Lily has recovered and her family will take her to hide in a safer place. Eve goes to have a look outside, and finds a Rustfire flyer containing the Chief’s obituary.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The toy family has all left Eve. What will be the outcome this time? She believes that you can make those lies and ideals come true, and she believes that you will return.</i></p>","interrogation4":"The patients are gathered outside the rehabilitation room in support of Eve, who is trying to take her first steps. Eve thinks about her old friends in the toy factory who wished for her to have a long, happy life outside the factory, to be able to go on a walk together. Andrew and Albert bicker outside, with Albert remarking that it is a miracle that Eve can even feel anything in her nerves. Andrew asks what they are waiting for, and Albert responds that of course, they are waiting for a miracle.\n\nEve manages to stand up for a brief moment and begins to cry, having found her motivation. Eve leaves the clinic to return to the MBCC, planning to wait for Chief as she believes they will return, determined to do her own part in making things better for others.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Inside the factory, when she lost her sanity in the pollution, you collected stories about her. And now, it’s her turn to learn everything about you, waiting for your awakening.</i></p>\n","arrestRec1":"During the aftermath of the toy factory incident, the rescue team discovered her traces in the contaminated ruins. After confirming that her mental and physical health were generally unharmed, the MBCC officially detained her for interrogation.","arrestRec2":"Eve is the child of the Buonanotte Toy Factory's owners. She lost her legs in a childhood accident and has been living in a wheelchair ever since. The same year, the factory's business suffered a blow and Eve's medical expenses became a burden as the factory kept losing money. Busy saving their business, the factory owners gradually lost touch with their daughter.","arrestRec3":"She voluntarily recruited many people in difficult circumstances as factory workers. Even at the factory's rock bottom, these workers held on to their duties. According to Eve, she spent most of her time with her employees.","arrestRec4":"Pressured by deficits and violent debt collectors, the factory eventually became a testing field for Mania weapons where an explosion of contamination occurred. As the sole survivor, Eve couldn't let go of the memories. She was talked into staying in the factory and constructed a toy ward with her special power.","servingTerm1":"When there are no field tasks, Eve is a night owl who only begins her activities after midnight. She likes to space out alone on the rooftop in the middle of night, hugging her toys.","servingTerm2":"She was initially reclusive and introverted, seldom communicating with others. But going to counseling and rehabilitation for her prosthetics has allowed her to interact with more Sinners and staff members. She has gradually overcome her social anxiety and is willing to engage in simple exchanges.\r","servingTerm3":"She has a knack for mechanical devices and a good artistic sense. But as she has said herself, she no longer makes new toys and doesn't regret the waste of these talents.","servingTerm4":"When Chief is present, Eve's treatment and therapy are significantly more effective. There is currently no scientific explanation for this change. It is speculated that Chief's presence reassures Eve, greatly boosting her motivation.\r\n","emotionCheck1":"[Eve examines two sets of doll outfits, each made from a different fabric.]\n\n**Eve:** Should the teddy bear wear the silk one... or is the cotton one better?\n\n**Chief:** ......\n\n* **Prompt:** It's getting cooler, go with cotton, it's warmer.\n * **Eve:** Cotton, huh? Does it make a difference? Both feel pretty similar to me... But, if that's what Chief suggests, I'll go with this set.\n * **Eve:** 😐\n\n* **Prompt:** The silk brings out a certain grace, matches its personality.\n * **Eve:** Chief has this childlike wonder, like they're in a happy fairy tale, always seeing the brighter side of the world...

Let me help you get there.\n * **Eve:** Why do all this... You must realize, you can't be there forever to remove every hurdle in my path...\n * **Eve:** 😥\n\n* **Prompt:** It's my duty to make sure physical barriers don't hold you back. I'll have these tiles fixed and your wheelchair upgraded too.\n * **Eve:** But it's not just these physical challenges that bind me; there are many others... I know you're waiting for me to conquer them one by one, but you might have to wait quite a bit longer... \n * **Eve:** 😦","supervision1":"++* ⚠ Dream Toy Hunt\n\n//Eve lends a hand in fulfilling [[[emp |EMP's]]] cherished wish.//\n\n**System Notifications:** You made a deal with EMP: engage in the Bureau's learning missions, and she gets a wish granted.

Fortunately, Eve saved the day, snagging the last pieces at a fair price.\n\n* **Prompt:** You are now the Lead Consultant for Toy Procurement.","supervision2":"++* ⚠ Unending Racket\n\n//You've been hit with a series of complaints about the relentless noise pollution.//\n\n**System Notifications:** Lately, we've seen a spike in gripes about noise pollution, all thanks to a freak outbreak of Cuckoo Clocks that started when Eve joined the Bureau. People are even making tunes out of their squawks. Ironically, Eve's getting a taste of her own medicine and has lodged a complaint.\n\n* **Prompt:** I guess the bell ringer can't unring the bell.","supervision3":"++* ⚠⚠ Escape Love Spell\n\n//Eve finds herself coerced into being a critique guest on a live stream.//\n\n**System Notifications:** At last, a break in the non-stop hustle, giving you a chance to randomly check up on the Sinners.\n\n* **Prompt:** Look up the locations of Sinners.\n\n**Chief:** Wait, why are Eve and [[[Nino]]] doing together in the secret room? Did Eve accidentally walk in on Nino's live stream while looking for some peace and quiet...?\n\n**System Notifications:** Just imagining the kind of mental turmoil Nino's loud and lively behavior might cause Eve is enough to make your head spin.\n\n**Chief:** Thankfully, it's easy to see how Nino's doing... Just need to take a peek at her current live stream.\n\n* **Prompt:** Enter Nino's live-stream\n\n**System Notifications:** Of course, when you click into Nino's live stream, there's Eve on screen, looking all awkward and stiff, clearly out of her element.\n\n**Eve:** This is obviously the wrong move. In your head, he's still the knight in shining armor from your childhood... but things have changed. People do.\n\n**Eve:** It's time to stop hoping for miracles; you and he can't rewind the past. If you keep this up, you'll be drained and left behind.\n\n**System Notifications:** While heading towards the secret room, you glance at the screen to see Eve clumsily commenting on a viewer's submission. Luckily, in this unlucky situation, her gloomy comments aren't met with backlash but surprisingly, a lot of thumbs-up.\n\n**Nino:** Nicely done! Look at you go—I told you you've got it! Keep it up, stay sharp, and shake that lovey-dovey out of their daze.\n\n**Chief:** ...Nino, what's this about? Pulling people into live streams now?\n\n**Eve:** Chief, thank god you're here... Ms. Nino, I'm really not cut out for live streaming. If you're looking for someone to spice up the atmosphere, maybe Chief can help...?\n\n**Nino:** Eve, don't underestimate yourself! What you just said was spot-on, sharp and to the point, really hitting where it hurts! That's sure to reach the hearts of those lovebirds who can't seem to let go.\n\n**Nino:** And hey, \"Pulling people\"? Could you phrase that better? Didn't you suggest that Eve should get more out there, find her own groove in society?\n\n**Chief:** You probably just wanted a buzz moment for the stream with Eve critiquing hopeless romantics... Remember, social rehab takes time. Eve's got to ease into it. Let's not mess things up with good intentions, okay?","supervision4":"++* ⚠⚠ Eternal Night\n\n//Rumors of the approaching Eternal Night have the Sinners restless with dread.//\n\n**System Notifications:** The hit movie \"[[[Keylan]]] Code\" is the latest craze in the Bureau, especially with the prophesized date looming.

We can't have these wild rumors messing with their treatment... Wait, what?\n\n**System Notifications:** You see that Eve's sessions are all flagged \"No Show\" in gray, meaning she's been missing her hypnotherapy.\n\n**Chief:** That's not a good sign... She wouldn't have fallen for that \"Eternal Night\" rumor and spiraled into depression, would she?\n\n* **Prompt:** Heading over to Eve.\n\n**Chief:** Hey Eve, I saw that you've skipped all your hypno sessions. You haven't just been lounging in bed all this time, have you...? Emm... what are you doing?\n\n**Eve:** Chief, good timing... I was just about to spruce up the bed for you. Which pillow do you like better... this one or that?\n\n**System Notifications:** Eve isn't the picture of gloom you expected. Instead, her typically bland room is surprisingly filled with colorful toys for decor, and even her teddy bear is sporting new threads.\n\n**Chief:** Awesome, so you didn't fall for that rumor... ahem, I mean, both choices are cute, and the teddy's outfit is charming. What's with the sudden shopping spree?\n\n**Eve:** Oh, there's some good news on the horizon, just getting a bit ready for it.\n\n**Chief:** Good news? But isn't Eve's birthday still quite a bit away?\n\n**Eve:** It's finally time to celebrate the Eternal Night... The night that never sees dawn is almost here, that's so nice.\n\n**Eve:** Hey, Little Bear, you're feeling the joy too, aren't you? Hang in there, all this sorrow and pain will soon be gone. I will be right here with you, always...\n\n**Eve:** Chief, when that moment arrives, will you lie down here and keep me company? Surrounded by our toys, we can drift off into a dream, a dream without any pain, a dream that lasts forever...\n\n**Chief:** Well... let's see, trying to squash the rumors on this side feels like a bigger challenge than it was on the other side...","supervision5":"++* ⚠⚠⚠ Accessible Pathways\n\n//Out of the blue, a vibrant rainbow bridge emerges in the Bureau's hallway.//\n\n**System Notifications:** Just another day at the office, and for once, you've managed to clear your desk.

Wait a sec, when did a rainbow bridge pop up in the hallway? Is that some new decor?\n\n**Eve:** Wait... Chief, is that you? Mind giving the thruster's light a quick look to see if it's lit?\n\n* **Prompt:** Looking around for where the voice is coming from.\n\n**Chief:** Eve, what are you doing up on that rainbow bridge? Did someone play a trick on you?\n\n**Eve:** No tricks, nope. This is an accessible zip line, custom-made by Miss [[[Summer]]] to suit my needs. Super fast and really handy.\n\n**Chief:** Ah, I get it now... I just took a look, and the light on the back of your wheelchair's strap is on. Not sure if that's the thruster, though.\n\n**System Notifications:** As you walk around Eve, you check the light for her, but you can't help but wonder: Do accessibility tools really need something like a thruster?\n\n**Eve:** Good, the light's on. Thanks for checking, Chief. I'll head out now, appreciate your help.\n\n* **Prompt:** Call out to her\n * **Chief:** Wait a second, Eve. I don't recall Summer ever getting these accessibility designs approved by me.\n * **Chief:** Meaning, I can't verify if it's up to the Bureau's accessibility standards. You might need to wait for an official okay before you can use it.\n * **Eve:** Really? But, you see, Miss Summer and I have tested this zip line several times already, and it's really safe.\n * **Eve:** Also, it ticks all the boxes for accessibility standards. It's got a cute look that blends well with the corridor, and it's hung high enough not to get in anyone's way as they walk by...\n * **Chief:** Huh, that design philosophy sounds a bit unusual...\n * **Eve:** And, with the thrusters attached, it's super fast. That means I can reduce the time I'm in everyone's way and make sure I'm not a roadblock in their daily hustle.\n * **Chief:** Listen, Eve, \"accessible facilities\" are meant to be obstacle-free for your use, not to ensure you're not in someone else's way...\n\n* **Prompt:** Let her leave\n * **Chief:** Uh, then, have a safe trip? And, you know, stay safe out there.\n * **Eve:** Bye, Chief.\n * **System Notifications:** You observe Eve clumsily hitting a button, setting the Rainbow Bridge gondola in motion. With the thrusters engaged, she and her wheelchair are launched at an astonishing speed, faster than you could've envisioned.\n * **Chief:** Eve—everything alright there?\n * **Eve:** ...\n * **System Notifications:** Eve gives no answer, likely missing your question entirely.

Lion's head, I'm really sorry, pal. I didn't do it on purpose!\n * **Eve:** Looks like she's not as tough as I assumed.

Regardless of how it acts, my only hope is that you really do cherish your lion's head, just like you claimed...\n * **System Notifications:** With both OwO and you watching intently or nervously, the lion's head gives its tassels a shake and twirls on the spot, looking for something, it seems.\n * **Chief:** Why's it heading my way... Hold on, these moves, they remind me of when OwO asked if I was interested in learning lion dance...\n * **OwO:** Roar—Hey, lion's head! Come back to OwO! OwO's the one who gets you, why on earth are you thinking of joining the DisCitizens?\n * **Eve:** The mechanism could give it a mind and movements like that girl's... Maybe it's really asking you if you fancy learning lion dancing from it.\n * **Chief:** Learning lion dance from a lion's head... sounds genuinely traditional, doesn't it?\n * **System Notifications:** You watch OwO nervously clutch the lion's head, who's floated back to her at last.

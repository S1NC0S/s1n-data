According to the investigation, the subject had also helped many WhiteSands bandits and exhibited many strange behaviors. His presence had also seriously affected the management practices around DIS, obstructing the regular flow of Hypercubes.\n\n--\n\nRecords show that since childhood, the subject lived a secluded life with his father who's also a cartographer. His ignorance of basic societal values can explain why he mistakenly took the supplies from the base station and aided the bandits. The subject is otherwise very knowledgeable in his professional area and is a very bright student.\n\nAfter some basic education, the subject can now fully comprehend how society works and is unlikely to suffer the same accusations again in the future.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nKawa-kawa's power can influence the beacon that he carries. When unfolded, it will form a small shelter that provides protection for those in it.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nWhile surveying alone, he encountered a sandstorm in the WhiteSands and awakened his power in the face of despair. In the end, he was able to make it through the crisis with his special powers and his remarkable survival skills.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nHe has recently awakened with a low level of corruption. He has a clear mind and a strong will. There is some stubborn behavior unrelated to corruption. No serious negative effects were detected due to Mania for the time being.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Daddy, is that you...\"","interrogation1":"Kawa-kawa is held in the interrogation room for multiple violation records. He's not sure why he's being held there only that he has important work to do back in WhiteSands. The Chief tries their best to explain to them that they're being held at the MBCC for being a Sinner. And not only did Kawa-kawa violate official regulations, but that he's aided and abetted bandits. He doesn't understand this line of thinking believing that's he's only been helping, and believes that everyone in WhiteSands values life more than themselves getting quite angry about the idea he shouldn't help someone. After showing him footage of people he's helped mowing down helpless cruiser crew members he gets a horrifying shock. While Chief explains that they should be more perceptive from now on it's almost glossed over as Kawa-kawa hears that he might be let out to help with a cleansing operation. Later on, Nightingale expresses her distrust for the boy, but the Chief trusts him as a navigator more than as a possible bandit.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Though Nightingale doesn't trust him, you let the boy join the MBCC's WhiteSands operation.\n\nYou trust the navigator in front of you more than data produced by so-called experts.</i></p>","interrogation2":"The mission goes awry, with an accident stranding the crew in the desert. Kawa-kawa while angry that there's not enough provisions to last until rescue immediately jumps to action to get more. In his naivety he doesn't realize that the place he remembers helping the people from were from the same group of bandits they were pursuing. The Chief lets him learn that his kindness isn't deserved by everyone. And in a tactical move the bandits are overtaken with the use of beacons belonging to Kawa-kawa preventing any harm to either side.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Kawa-kawa uses his power to fight for the first time.\r\n\r\nHis power is supposed to be gentle, and used to protect everyone.\r\n\r\nHowever, some people don't deserve his kindness.</i></p>","interrogation3":"Hunkered down in the now taken fortress the Chief and crew are waiting out the sandstorm as Kawa-kawa returns with provisions. On this day they're to reset the beacons to better wait out the sandstorm. Kawa-kawa reminisces about how his father was looked down upon by his village and even himself. While he believed his father to be stupid he eventually realizes how important his father's and grandfather's work was to navigating the desert safely. He never did find his father, but he continues his forefather's work regardless in hopes of helping others like they did. The Chief reassures him that it's possible his father may follow his beacons back to him like how his father's beacons led him to safety.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Like his forefathers, Kawa-kawa has dedicated his all to WhiteSands.\n\nThe beacons beaming a bright blue light across the desert are his future goals.\n\nThey shall connect to the sky and merge with the stars.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"He was put on the watch list by the FAC for repeatedly helping the bandits in the WhiteSands. The MBCC encountered him in the WhiteSands while on a mission and took him into custody the moment he was discovered to be a Sinner.","arrestRec2":"Having always lived a secluded life, the subject struggles to blend into human society due to the lack of common sense, and has a unique yet incorrect understanding of social intercourse. The subject will help anyone who asks for help without hesitation.","arrestRec3":"Vigorous and resilient, the subject has both the abilities and the experience to survive in the wild. It's like a walk in the park that the subject can even spare some attention to help those who are in danger.","arrestRec4":"Born in the borderland of The DisCity in a town near the WhiteSands, the subject lost his mother when he was little, and he rarely saw his father. The townsfolk laughed at him, calling him the son of a fool. When he turned eight, he received valuable research data from his father. Since then, he has carried on the legacy of his father and the father before him and taken up the mantle of drawing a map of the WhiteSands.","servingTerm1":"His luggage weighs 20kg and is something he will not abandon under any circumstances. Inside are the necessities of survival in the wilderness and hundreds of surveying maps, which Kawa-kawa considers \"life dependent\".","servingTerm2":"As a result of reading books left by his grandfather and father since childhood, Kawa-kawa is far more knowledgeable than his peers. This is especially true in wilderness survival, where he has reached the expert level with strong theoretical knowledge and extensive first-hand experience. ","servingTerm3":"He easily believes the lies of others and have been deceived many times by other Sinners to perform dangerous work on their behalf. However, Kawa-kawa has no complaints about this and is even happy to do it. He sees it as a necessity to reach her ideals. ","servingTerm4":"Kawa-kawa cherishes the surveying manuscripts of his father and grandfather very much. But he made an exception and presented a copy of a map to the Chief. He invited the Chief to survey with him so as not to disappoint his father's ideals.

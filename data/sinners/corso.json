Has a history of disturbing public order, violating rules in combat, and starting brawls. The subject is extremely aggressive and uncontrollable. Immediate detainment is recommended.\n\n--\n\nThe subject had been a competitive fighter in the underground fighting world. Boasting a fierce and cut-throat personality, she exhibits an usually strong thirst for combat, and has a history of arrest for inciting unrest while fighting in the right. Thanks to Chief's patient efforts, her impulsive personality has changed for the better. Now, she is willing to follow the MBCC's orders and actively complete dispatch missions. By channeling her power and energy to positive things, she is gradually getting on the right track.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nShe can radically increase the power of any physical substance at hand. When used well in battle, her power can deal huge damage at a tiny cost.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nThe subject got infected after coming into contact with large amounts of Mania weapons in the underground fighting ring.

However, from our observations, the subject exhibits an abnormally strong desire to fight as well as mental instability, which are all symptoms typical of Mania.\r\n","ecbFlavourText":"\"Haha... Is this... the taste of victory!\"","interrogation1":"The Chief confronts Corso in the interrogation room about why she went AWOL during a recent field operation. Corso states nonchalantly that since her assigned tasks have been too easy, she left to participate in several fighting contests. The Chief suspects that she may have been colluding with former members of Rustfire, now Manic, but Corso denies this, renouncing Rustfire and its ideals. To her, the organization was nothing more than a way for her to find greater opponents to fight. She explains that she is searching for a particular man whom she failed to defeat, and that by defeating him, she will claim the title of greatest underground fighter.\n\nGiven that the Chief cannot allow Corso to wander freely, they attempt to placate her with the promise of more difficult missions. Corso is adamant about wanting to pursue her \"hobby,\" but when the Chief threatens to revoke her field privileges altogether, she relents and agrees to the terms.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Corso claims that she's only left to participate in the fight and to look for her past opponent. She also firmly denies her relations with the Rustfire remnants.\nYou demand that Corso stop leaving without permission. After weighing the pros and cons, she reluctantly agrees.</i></p>","interrogation2":"After receiving a call from EMP confirming that Corso has once again gone AWOL, the Chief uses the Shackles to track her to an underground Syndican fighting arena. They overhear a conversation between two gangsters about whether Angus, the reigning champion, or Mad Dog — Corso, known for playing dirty — would win in a fight. Thanks to the arrival of Corso herself, they narrowly avoid a confrontation, and Corso gets them inside free of scrutiny.\n\nThe Chief wonders about the M-Values of the people in the audience. Angus, having just finished a fight, makes eye contact with Corso, calling her into the pit. The two agree to finally settle their feud, but before the match begins, the Chief pulls Corso aside. Once they confirm that Angus is the one Corso has been looking for, they agree to allow her to fight him on two conditions: one, that she return to the Bureau regardless of the match's outcome, and two, that she not fight anyone else besides Angus. Corso agrees, allowing the Chief to tighten the Shackles' hold on her to ensure she obeys.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Corso saved you from the thugs and took you into the fight stadium. There, you meet the opponent Corso has been feeling bitter about, Chief gladiator Angus. They've promised to have a fight. You permit Corso to compete, but only on two conditions.</i></p>","interrogation3":"Chief watches from the stands as the fight begins. Corso has no qualms with dishonorable tactics, which, combined with her dexterity, soon turn the tide in her favor. On the verge of defeat, Angus attempts to beat Corso at her own game, throwing knives he'd hidden on his person, but Corso outdoes him once again. Angus then gives a signal for a group of fighters to storm the arena. Although once defeated by her in the past, Corso is unable to counterattack due to the Shackles' restraints. She manages to avoid them until they draw their Mania weapons. The Chief, now having both legal and personal reasons to do so, jumps into the arena to intervene.\n\nUnbound, Corso quickly subdues the fighters, Angus included, and is crowned Queen of the Arena. Triumphant, the two get in a car bound for the Bureau, where the Chief entices Corso with her greatest opponent yet: the whole of the Mania crisis. As long as they provide her the most dangerous tasks, Corso agrees to fight alongside them.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>It's a gladiator's fate to pursue victory. Everyone gives their best to reach this goal, and sometimes they don't choose the most noble method. While Corso chooses determination, Angus chooses a more unsavory way. As for you, you choose not to stand by and watch. You must help Corso climb to the top and claim the glory she deserves.\nFinally, the winner Corso agrees to stay and see the MBCC as the next battlefield she must conquer.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"The subject had been active in Syndicate's various fighting arenas. She openly flaunts her Sinner identity, impacting competition fairness and triggering unrest. The subject was eventually subdued by local sheriffs and handed over to the MBCC.","arrestRec2":"As a child, the subject was homeless and roamed Syndicate before getting taken in by a dog pound, where she ate and lived with the dogs. She was later expelled from the pound after getting into a fight with some competitive fighters. This spurred her to join the underground fighting industry.","arrestRec3":"Small in stature, the subject lacks the strength of other fighters, so she wins her fights with clever tricks. However, her tricky fighting style is widely despised. Many think it goes against the long-held Syndicate tradition of valuing sheer strength, and thus reject her.","arrestRec4":"The subject skyrocketed to fame after using her Sinner power to win a major competition, becoming a fan favorite in the underground fighting world. However, many arenas shut down after Zoya destroyed the gangs. The subject went back to living in the streets, and later joined Rustfire.","servingTerm1":"The subject is passionate about any combat mission, and will even request extra tasks. When she fails to exhaust her energy, she'll challenge other Sinners to fight, but there is rarely anyone willing to accept her challenge. Everyone basically responds by giving her their own assignment.","servingTerm2":"The subject regards make-up as \"combat gear\" and asks the Supply Office to procure all kinds of make-up for her. According to her, flamboyant makeup is a must-have in battle, as it is an effective way to intimidate and deter opponents.","servingTerm3":"The subject loves to craft weapons and props. She sometimes takes her creations to chat with Sinner Mess, whom she praises as \"very insightful.\" The subject likes to use garbage found around the Bureau as crafting materials, and sometimes even goes out scavenging with Sinner Demolia.","servingTerm4":"The subject once handed the Chief a huge sum of money and explained it was prize money earned from a fighting match she joined while out on dispatch. She generously declared that she'll hand over all future prize money if the Bureau turned a blind eye to such disciplinary violations. After accepting the money, the Chief tightened disciplinary measures for Sinners out on dispatch.","emotionCheck1":"[Corso paints herself with the newly arrived oil paints.]\r\n\r\n**Corso:** The ones bought by the MBCC is not very waterproof...

Rumor has it that her perfumes can bring everlasting youth, which makes them popular among the rich and famous. Investigations suggest that she may be spreading Mania and abducting members of the public, and must be detained immediately.\n\n--\n\nThanks to the Chief's patient teaching and management, the subject's understanding of societal norms has significantly improved, and the distorted views caused by her eccentric upbringing have been somewhat corrected. While living at the Bureau, she no longer exhibits extreme behaviors, and regularly receives psychological treatment and engages in normal perfume-making activities.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nHer special power can extract fragrances from the human body and make special perfumes that make those who smell them happy, invigorated, and have everlasting youth.

Coupled with her eccentric upbringing, she developed a highly distorted worldview.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Only this type of fragrance...can count as salvation.\"\n","interrogation1":"After finding samples of perfumes that contain traces of [[[Mania]]], the [[[Public Security Bureau]]] sends the Chief files for numerous missing person’s cases. Although each case is unsolved, they all are regarding beautiful women, and each missing woman has a name that matches with a discovered perfume. The PSB is also unable to determine the identity of the perfumer who created them, but they provide the Chief with an invitation to a gala where the offending perfumes will be sold. There, the Chief overhears gossip that there will be an auction for a perfume that can grant eternal youth. They are approached by an investigative journalist named [[[list-of-minor-characters |Lucas]]]; his daughter is one of the missing women, but he hasn’t yet found a perfume with her name.\n\nThe [[[Shackles]]] activate suddenly and point the Chief towards Cassia, whom they find in the process of using her ability on a sleeping woman. The Chief quickly Shackles her and takes her atomizer, which seems to be the medium through which Cassia activates her power. To their surprise Cassia appears unconcerned about her arrest, only demanding the return of her perfume. Through the Shackles, the Chief senses no emotions whatsoever from her, leaving them unsettled and uncertain about the interrogation to come.\n\n//At the perfume gala, you not only meet Lucas, an investigative journalist claiming to be a victim’s father, but also shackle Cassia and prevent new victims from appearing. The photo of Lucas’s daughter is not only a clue, but also a father’s prayer. You will carry it with you as you formally interrogate the perfumer.//","interrogation2":"After half an hour of interrogation, the Chief has failed to get any information from Cassia besides her name. Any other question is met with total indifference and complaints about the smell in the interrogation room. However, Cassia’s condition rapidly deteriorates, ultimately leading to an emotional breakdown that forces the Chief to stabilize her with the Shackles. This evokes a sudden change in her demeanor, as Cassia begins to praise the Chief’s fragrance and cooperate with their questioning. Cassia explains that she possesses a supernaturally strong sense of smell, able to even discern the scents of different people. When she broke down before, she had remembered the smell of blood from a traumatic incident in her past, which she says is imprinted on her mind and follows her constantly unless she uses her ability to create a special perfume that keeps it at bay. She is enamored with the Shackles, which apparently transmit the Chief’s scent and are capable of driving away the bloody smell. \r\n\r\nTaking advantage of Cassia’s new attitude, the Chief resumes questioning her about the disappearances. Cassia confirms that her perfumes are inspired by the body scents of the missing women, but insists that she would have no reason to harm them. The Chief shows her a picture of Lucas’s daughter, Fleur, but Cassia has no recollection of her appearance. However, the Chief pushes deeper, and detects through the Shackles that Cassia is having an emotional response to the memory of a perfume with her name. Although Cassia is not forthcoming with answers, the Chief demands to be taken to the perfumery where she stores her scents.\r\n\r\n//Your shackles successfully soothe Cassia’s indescribable fear. She changes her attitude and begins to cooperate with your questioning. However, when you test Cassia with the name and photo of Lucas’s daughter Fleur, her reaction is somewhat suspicious. You decide to take her to the perfume room to further investigate.//","interrogation3":"Cassia shows the Chief around her perfumery. Although she is proud of the fragrances she has created from the missing women, she continues to search for more ingredients because their scents always vanish quickly. She begins to rave about the Chief’s fragrance, which she believes is the perfect ingredient for her to reach the pinnacle of her craft. Lucas suddenly breaks into the perfumery, having tailed the Chief and Cassia there. He demands to know what happened to Fleur, and Cassia recounts a story from her youth: as the adopted daughter of a man who collected beautiful women, Cassia had lured Fleur from her home in the city’s slums to the Collector’s house, not understanding the consequences of doing so. There Fleur was imprisoned, and when she tried to escape, she was murdered by the Collector. The smell of Fleur’s blood traumatized her, but also awakened her as a Sinner. Cassia turned Fleur’s fragrance into a perfume, which she used to preserve her beauty (and thus her life, from the Collector’s wrath) until the Collector died.\r\n\r\nHorrified by this revelation, Lucas drops the bottle containing Fleur’s perfume, shattering it. Cassia confesses that all this time, she has been trying to make a perfume that can replace Fleur; with the last of Fleur’s perfume gone, Cassia flies into a rage, forcing the Chief to subdue her with the Shackles again. The Chief asks why she continued to help the Collector even after seeing his true colors, but Cassia fails to understand the fault in her complicity, believing that her actions are vindicated by her need to obtain protective scents to survive. The Chief regrets that Cassia’s upbringing has made her both a perpetrator and a victim, but resolves that she will require strict control and reeducation to save. Cassia refuses to concede that she must stop harming people, and presents the ultimatum that she will do so only if the Chief lets her create a perfect perfume from their scent. The Chief denies this, countering that they will use the Shackles regularly to prevent future breakdowns from her psychosis. Though Cassia doesn’t accept this outcome, she is powerless to resist it.\r\n\r\nThe Chief has a final conversation with Lucas, and apologizes that they can’t even allow him to keep the remains of Fleur’s perfume, as it is contaminated with Mania. Lucas recounts that Fleur was always happy to help anybody in need, and he believes that she would still be happy that she helped Cassia even after her death, and that because of her sacrifice nobody else would need to suffer again. Alone in her room at the MBCC, Cassia luxuriates in the smell of a mysterious perfume made from a strand of black hair.\r\n\r\n//Lucas, who suddenly barged in, finds the perfume named “Fleur.” You learn from Cassia about what happened to Fleur, and about her own dark past. Lost lives can’t be saved, but at least you can break the cycle and try to remove Cassia’s darkness.//","arrestRec1":"Due to her intentional spreading of Mania and suspected involvement in many disappearances over the years, the subject was personally arrested by the MBCC Chief at the perfume gala she hosted.","arrestRec2":"The subject was adopted by a wealthy collector in Eastside when she was very young. Because of her beautiful appearance and extraordinary sense of smell, she was favored and lived a privileged life. After the collector's death, she inherited all his wealth as the only heir.","arrestRec3":"The subject refuses to admit that her actions violate the law. In her view, spreading Mania perfume isn't harmful to others, but rather a generous act of kindness. Those lucky enough to use them have a chance of getting an even greater honor: becoming the inspiration for her next perfume.","arrestRec4":"After witnessing her foster father's atrocities, the subject awakened her special power in extreme horror, which traumatized her sense of smell: she now constantly smells an unbearable stench. The reason she started making perfumes was to soothe her own mental state. However, her perfumes' scent never lasts long enough, so she has always longed to create an \"Immortal Fragrance\" that will never fade.","servingTerm1":"The subject is passionate about collecting glass bottles of various styles. After the Supply Office tabulated her procurement list, it was discovered that she purchased bottles with plant and flower designs the most, followed by animal and insect designs.","servingTerm2":"The subject has extremely high standards for perfume quality, and will start over if there is the slightest imperfection in the perfume-making process. One day, she was spotted dumping perfume into the sewage treatment pool, claiming they were flawed waste materials that were no different from sewage.","servingTerm3":"During her detention, the subject kept a low profile and hardly participated in social activities with other Sinners. However, she showed an extraordinary interest in specific people, expressing her admiration and approval by imagining and describing their scents. Without exception, all of these people have beautiful appearances.","servingTerm4":"The subject regularly receives psychological counseling and rehabilitation from the Chief. During these sessions, she has repeatedly expressed her wish to make perfume inspired by the Chief, but has not been granted permission.","emotionCheck1":"[Cassia is browsing perfume reviews online in the Recreation Area.]\n\n**Cassia:** The scent of perfume is becoming more complex, more industrialized, almost covering up the pure scent...

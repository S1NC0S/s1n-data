According to investigations, the subject secretly works with many different forces, and has helped Eastside's big entertainment companies catapult stars to fame.\n\nThe subject once created a type of cosmetic surgery that can completely swap one person's face with another's. However, according to investigations, this popular operation became intertwined with many missing persons cases, and was quickly banned.\n\n--\n\nAccording to observations, the subject can indeed use mirrors to cast her power. At present, all mirrors in the operating room have been destroyed. Since getting detained by the MBCC, the subject has gradually calmed down, and her attention has shifted from face-stealing to Chief. The MBCC will continue to monitor the subject's power so as to prevent her from committing further crimes.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nHer power can turn [[[mania |Mania Crystals]]] into mirrors.

She is sullen and impatient, and while she acknowledges that the disappeared actors were her clients, she denies any knowledge of what happened to them. The Chief attempts to use the [[[Shackles]]] to compel an answer, but they are repelled by a purple light when they try to push deeper. She accuses them of trying to frame her for a crime just because she's a [[[Sinner]]], but the Chief replies that they have no intention of wronging her and that despite being a prison warden, it's part of their principles to get to know the Sinners under their watch. Uni recounts a version of the story of the Ugly Duckling where the duckling drowns and dies in its pursuit of beauty. She then conjures a mirror that she claims reveals the deepest desire of anybody who looks into it, however, the Chief only sees their own reflection. When they relate this to Uni, she excitedly proclaims that the Chief is the \"blank canvas\" that she has been looking for. \n\nThe interrogation is interrupted by [[[Nightingale]]], who tells them that a [[[city council |City Councilor]]] is demanding that the Chief bring Uni to a function in Eastside that night, due to her influence and reputation as a star-maker. Nightingale also gives them a photo of [[[list of minor characters |Luna]]], Uni's identical twin sister who went missing three years prior. The Chief further ponders the fact that Uni's reflection did not appear in her own mirror.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Uni mocks those missing persons that they got what they deserved. As the interrogation progresses, you gradually realize Uni has her own agenda.\nYou were told that Uni is an irreplaceable part of the star-making industry, thus you decide to accept the councilor's invitation and infiltrate the cocktail party to uncover the truth.</i></p>","interrogation2":"At the Councilor's cocktail party, Uni sticks to the corner, eating desserts while disparaging the other guests for their shallowness. The Councilor approaches them with a young woman who is beautiful, but hasn't yet broken through in the DisCity entertainment world. He requests that Uni give her cosmetic surgery in order to turn her into a star, and the Chief agrees, seeing it as an opportunity to see Uni's process and learn something about the missing persons case. The actress reveals that she has an audition for a movie the next day, and has researched the director's favorite type of woman so that she can change her face to be more likely to get the role. The Chief doesn't approve, which strikes her as ridiculous; as Uni goes into her clinic ahead of them, the Chief tricks her into believing that they have a different acting opportunity for her that requires her current face, and she leaves.\n\nThe Chief follows Uni into the clinic and finds it meticulously clean, but filled with hundreds of cracked mirrors. They explore and find a portrait on the wall made out of pieces of different people's headshots, cut up and affixed together to make an image that looks like Uni's face. Each of the pieces comes from one of the missing persons, and the figure's eyes are from a photo of the Chief. Uni appears and attacks them, forcing the Chief to use the Shackles against her.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>In this greed-filled cocktail party, Uni shows you the immoral and hypocritical side of the guests. You lure the girl who wants plastic surgery away with her desire, but you fall into Uni's trap yourself; this has all been a plan to approach you. Her real target is none other than you.</i></p>","interrogation3":"The Chief enters Uni's [[[spiritual energy |spiritual realm]]], where they take the role of Uni's twin sister Luna and encounter a young Uni living in an orphanage. Uni treats her sister almost as an extension of herself, insisting that they are each other's \"reflection\" and demanding that everything between them share \"symmetry\". A group of other kids accuse her of cheating on the test and stealing their candy, leading Uni to get into a fight with them when they claim that she was trying to impress Luna. After the Chief saves her, Luna promises that she and Uni will be together forever.\n\nLater in time, as adults, Luna sits on a bed in their shared apartment, her face covered in bandages. Uni hysterically asks why Luna left her to become an actress, saying that Luna ruined her face and wasn't returning her calls. Uni tries to talk with her sister, but Luna is silent. The memories break down into chaotic glimpses, and the Chief witnesses a fight between Uni and another woman, and then Uni's grief at having accidentally disfigured her. The Chief tries to talk to Uni and affirm to her that Luna is gone, but Uni insanely claims that Luna is still with her, trapped inside her mirror. As her spiritual realm collapses, the Chief finally gets through to her by explaining that she is mistaking them for Luna because Luna and the Chief were both people trying to protect her. Back in reality, the Chief tells her that the Shackles are not a cage, but a bridge between them, and Uni accepts it as the proof of a truly unbreakable bond with another person which she has been yearning for.\n\nA week later, Nightingale reports to the Chief that Uni's clinic has been closed down and the missing persons located, although each is missing a feature of their face, and the parts are still unfound. She gives the Chief a framed photograph of Luna that was also found inside the clinic. The Chief says they will give it Uni as a remembrance. In Uni's mirror, the Chief sees a sleeping woman with a pieced-together face.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Looks are deceiving. Souls are ugly. Only her twin sister who's linked to her by blood can be trusted. Uni tries in vain to put together her sister's face again and bring her back, but you cannot complete this fake consolation.\nThe shackles grow and link you and Uni together. This is a relationship that exists solely between the two of you, beyond all falsehood and connected by the souls.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"The subject has long been engaged in underground cosmetic surgery work in Eastside. Some of her clients disappeared after undergoing surgery. After a tip-off, she was confirmed to be a Sinner and arrested in the operating room.","arrestRec2":"In all the relevant cases, the missing persons had visited Uni's clinic and underwent cosmetic surgery. The subject denies all accusations, claiming that her mirrors only show people the faces they desire to have, and does not have the capacity for crime.","arrestRec3":"The subject grew up in an orphanage and harbors strong hostility towards everyone except her sister. She has shown strong learning abilities since childhood, and was admitted to Banyan Medical College as an adult to conduct research on the \"physical alteration and clinical recovery of mutants\". Her twin sister Luna failed to get into the program.","arrestRec4":"Before dropping out, the subject had a fight with her sister over her career, which led to her scratching her sister's face. Not long after, Luna disappeared, and the subject dropped out of school and vanished.\r\n\r\nA year later, she reappeared as a cosmetician. Ever since, missing persons cases related to her increased year by year.","servingTerm1":"The subject has extreme obsessive-compulsive disorder. She insists that everything in her room be arranged symmetrically, and bars anyone else from entering her room. According to observations, the subject shows an equally strong desire to control personal items. ","servingTerm2":"The subject has an insatiable sweet tooth. She accepts almost any food that is sweet and has an enormous appetite. Once, another Sinner pranked her by replacing her usual high-end desserts with cheap pastries, but the subject did not get angry after finding out. It seems that she doesn't care about food quality, just sweetness. ","servingTerm3":"Has an extremely low desire to socialize, and almost never tries to chat with other Sinners and staff. Some Sinners have gone to consult her about plastic surgery out of curiosity, but the staff promptly stopped her from inspecting their faces. ","servingTerm4":"Highly possessive of the Chief, she often uses the shackles in a brash manner to confirm the Chief's presence. After the Chief coaxed her not to do so, she changed her behavior for the better, opting instead to invite the Chief to spend time with her.

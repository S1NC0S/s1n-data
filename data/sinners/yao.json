Two months after [Ode to Sun], the S-Rank Bianca will be released to complete the Weakspot team, which looks to be as strong as/stronger than Bleed.

This means yes, Yao will still kill them.    \n    \n- Du Ruo synergy: As there is a short delay before two stacks of Du Ruo's [Rite] kills a Sinner, you can quickly place two stacks of [Rite] and Yao's Ultimate on the same Sinner to make full use of one death. Yao can function fine without Du Ruo, though.    \n    \n- Unlike Sinners like Lady Pearl, you cannot cancel her 2-second Ultimate animation lock, so her Ultimate duration is really only 13 seconds.

You saved it. Different plants need different conditions to grow and bloom. The fellows who delivered this cactus knew nothing about plants. They delivered it while the sunlight simulator was being serviced, and without the right conditions, it couldn't grow.\n\n**Chief:** I see... That's why you have been spending so much time in the greenhouse lately. You're here to provide heat and light for the plant, right?\n\n**Yao:** Yes. I'd thought my presence would cause the plants and their flowers to wither. But to my surprise, they thrived with less water. It's strange.\n\n**Coquelic:** There is no lack of water and fertilizer around here. Some \"botanists\" come almost every day to water them.

Anyway, I'm surprised that you're willing to use your power to do perms for others.\n\n**Yao:** Why not? It brings me joy using my power to make others feel good about themselves.

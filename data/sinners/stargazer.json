Known as the \"Dangerous Stargazer\" due to mixing with desert bandits and stirring up violence.\n\nHid the identity as a Sinner during the MBCC's bandit investigation, and maliciously hindered the investigation and intensified conflicts using her powers, seriously staking the relationship between DisCity and the nearby [[[Outland |city-states.]]]\n\n--\n\nThe file states that the subject's awakened power enables her to read others' thoughts. Conflicts mostly arise when she bluntly expresses her crude opinions, though she never speaks maliciously on purpose.\n\nSince her detention, the subject seems to have taken a special interest in Chief. She is mostly compliant with orders and no longer stirs up trouble.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\n\r\nThe psychic ability uses void-related mental pollutants as a medium to connect to the void and attack with the power of the void.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\n\r\nThe Stargazer claimed to have a mental breakdown when searching for her \"kind\" and fell into the WhiteSands. Having been accepted and saved by the Void that recognized her spirit, she crossed the Door of Void, saw the Realm of Truth, and thus awakened.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\n\r\nHas moderate erosion and occasional hallucinations. The subject's unpredictable behaviors are influenced by Mania to some extent.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Come with me to the land of dreams...\"","interrogation1":"Some time after the events of Raging Sands, the Stargazer turns herself in to the MBCC because she wishes to tell the Chief a new prophecy. She reminds the Chief of her prediction that the world will end and asks them to go with her to the Realm of Truth, but they insist that as a human born in this world, they choose to die with it too -- not that they believe her prophecies. Using her cards, she foretells a journey filled with confusion and deception, ending in the Chief's death. The Chief is dismissive, but before the interrogation can continue, they are called away by an urgent request for help from the [[[Framework Against Catastrophe |FAC]]]. The [[[Broken Frontline]]] has come under attack by a well-equipped force attempting to break through into [[[BR-000]]], and high [[[M-Values |Mania]]] indicate that the attackers are either assisted by [[[Sinners |Sinner]]] or are already [[[Corruptors |Corruptor]]]. As the Chief leaves, Stargazer tells them that the prophesied journey is about to begin.","interrogation2":"The Chief arrives at the Broken Frontline along with a force of MBCC officers and finds a group of FAC soldiers standing over the bodies of dead people in civilian clothes. When the Chief investigates the corpses and damage to the base's force field shield, they realize that both were caused by the same weapons, the kind wielded by gangsters rather than FAC officers. The soldiers suddenly turn on them and massacre the Chief's men; they are revealed to be [[[Outland]]] raiders who believe that the Broken Frontline's purpose is really to hide the government's supply of [[[Hypercubes |Hypercube]]], and have killed the real FAC soldiers and traded clothes. The Chief tries to convince them that breaking through the Frontline will only make their Mania worse, but they resume assaulting the shield while their leader attacks the Chief. Nearly transformed into a Corruptor, their Maniac strength nearly suffocates the Chief before Stargazer appears and rescues them. She points to these events as evidence of her prophecy, and refuses to help the Chief stop the attackers; although they point out that breaching the Frontline would cause a calamity that would kill many, Stargazer is eager to see her prophecy of the world's end come true. Still, she reminds the Chief that by [[[Shackles |Shackling]]] her, they have the power to take the future into their own hands.","interrogation3":"Stargazer lays out the Chief's choices: either do nothing and die when the attackers break through the Frontline as she prophesied, or Shackle her and force her to stop them. With the barrier on the verge of collapse, the Chief knows that using the Shackles would cause them to be swallowed by the [[[DisSea]]], but this is exactly what Stargazer wants, saying it will allow them to enter the Realm of Truth together. She attempts to convince them that the world is full of falsehood, that their colleagues and companions lie to them constantly, and that they can't trust anybody in this world. Nevertheless, the Chief insists that regardless of why the Dreamflower may have chosen them, they have also been chosen to play a purpose by the people of this world. They resolve that they will overturn Stargazer's prophecy with their own hands, and as the attackers transform into Corruptors en masse, they pull their gun on Stargazer, forcing her to drop them into the mass of Corruptors.","interrogation4":"Stargazer laments that when faced with a choice between truth, falsehood, and the duty they claimed to have, the Chief would end up choosing death. She turns to leave them to their fate, but is shocked to hear the sound of gunshots as the Chief fights their way out of the mass of Corruptors. The Chief shackles her and commands her to protect them, and together the two fight defeat the Corruptors, returning the roiling DisSea to its usual contained state. Stargazer is in awe that the Chief was able to overturn her prophecy, and they reach into her pocket to reveal another card: the reaper signifying death having turned into a star of hope. The Chief says that they don't know who they are or what their destiny is, but they hope that after everything comes to pass, their false body will give life to a true soul. Stargazer eagerly decides to follow the Chief to witness the moment that they discover the truth of this world.","arrestRec1":"Recognizes that the Chief was extremely likely to be her \"kind\" that she had been searching for years. After the WhiteSands Ruins incident was resolved, the subject left vague, ambiguous messages, and escaped amidst the chaos.

Many different versions of the subject's childhood circulate in WhiteSands, but all are proved to be rumors.\n","arrestRec3":"Wanders around and makes a living by fortune-telling. Never settled in a place before arriving at the oasis and let the crystal ball and the tarot determine where to go.","arrestRec4":"Arrived at the oasis under the guidance of fate to look for her \"kind.\" Under the inspiration summoning, the subject opened the ruins to seek the real and pure world by manipulating the desert bandits and beasts.","servingTerm1":"Stargazer sealed all the corners in the house that could let in light and used candles instead of incandescent lights.

Her contraptions are often hard to control and have caused numerous disturbances disrupting public order.\n\nSubsequent investigation revealed that an allegedly man-made explosion occurred in a suburban factory when Eureka was an employee there. As a major suspect, she was to be immediately detained and interrogated.\n\n--\n\nUpon interrogation, it was learned that Eureka didn't intentionally make the weapons that harmed innocent civilians but was deceived and coerced into doing so. During her detention in the MBCC, she proves to be sincere and kind, earning the favor and recognition of many within the Bureau. Under Chief's supervision and guidance, invention-related accidents have also significantly reduced. Eureka is evaluated to be no longer a threat to society.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\nHer special power can change or enhance a material's properties, facilitating her invention process. Her weapon of choice is a specially modified screwdriver which she uses as a tool in daily life and as a slender sword in combat.\n\n+++* Awakening Signs\nAccording to Eureka, she awakened as a Sinner several years ago when she accidentally touched Mania-tainted raw materials while manufacturing weapons in a black market workshop.\n\n+++* Corruption State\nPhysical examination results show that Eureka's level of corruption is low with no physical mutations, and all indicators are within the normal range. She is generally lucid and emotionally stable, with occasional fluctuations when recalling past experiences.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Finally got all the wrenches and screwdrivers back...\"\n\"From today on...

After the incident, she returned to the MBCC with Chief and willingly turned herself in without any resistance.","arrestRec2":"She is absent-minded and reticient, yet her mind is a playground of ideas with boundless imagination. She is obsessed with invention and creation, often traveling to various places in search of fresh inspiration. Beyond her string of novel yet impractical inventions, she seems to have a fair understanding of weapon development as well.","arrestRec3":"Born into a humble working-class family in Eastside, Eureka's childhood was rather stifling. With her parents' tough lives, they projected all their hopes onto her, frequently chastising her for mediocre grades and her penchant for handicrafts. Her school life was no different. Her eccentric hobbies earned her the label of a <i>freak</i>, leading to isolation and bullying.","arrestRec4":"During her university years, Eureka met her best friend Jessie. With aligned interests, they often collaborated on invention and research. After dropping out of school, she followed Jessie to work at her uncle's factory. It wasn't until she accidentally touched Mania-tainted materials and awakened as a Sinner that she realized the factory was in fact a black market weapon workshop. Unwilling to aid in the making of harmful inventions, she seized an opportunity to cause a disturbance and successfully escaped the factory.","servingTerm1":"Even after joining the MBCC, she's never ceased her invention. However, the constant noise from her room greatly disrupted the daily life of other Sinners in the Bureau. A small workshop was thus set up n a secluded corner specifically for her creative endeavors.","emotionCheck1":"[Eureka is browing a sci-fi movie magazine.]\n\n**Eureka:** These props in the movies are intriguing... Hey Chief, got any movie gadget you want me to whip up?\n\n**Chief:** ......\n\n* **Prompt:** I want an invisibility cloak.\n * **Eureka:** Let's see, if I mesh together some cameras and special screen fabric, it might just work...

She's unfazed by leftovers rejected by other Sinners for their less-than-stellar cooking. Thanks to this, she's the cafeteria lady's favorite, often rewarded with bonus sweet treats.\n\n* **Prompt:** Eureka, a more balanced diet is better for your health.","supervision4":"++* ⚠⚠ Practical Ingenuity\n\n//Eureka's breakthrough with the time-space travel device is all the rage.//\n\n**System Notifications:** Lately, we've picked up that certain Sinners are overstaying their welcome in the Training Room, way beyond what's permitted.

It's been a hit this year! Used so much that it's starting to show wear and tear. Thought I'd drop by for a bit of tinkering and maybe tweak a few things.\n\n**Eureka:** Perfect timing, Chief. I need your input... It's got massage and music features already. What do you think—should I go for a shaking option, or maybe an eject feature?\n\n* **Prompt:** Ask for more details.\n\n**Chief:** I haven't had a chance to try this machine out, so I can't really say. Eureka, how does this thing actually work? Does it genuinely travel through time?\n\n**Eureka:** Absolutely. The first time I tested it, it kicked into gear before I knew what was happening... and when I opened my eyes again, it was the next day! It's pretty amazing...\n\n**Eureka:** Others who've tried it have zipped a few hours into the future at least, and one even jumped a full day.\n\n**System Notifications:** Leaning in for a closer look inside the machine, you see it's got just enough room for someone to stretch out, with a layer of dry, cozy velvet and dim lighting.\n\n**Chief:** Wait a second, I've got a theory... Eureka, your music player, what's it playing?\n\n**Eureka:** What, this? It's just some easy-listening tunes I snagged from the hypnosis room...\n\n**Chief:** ...Just as I thought...

So why are there repair requests? That's bizarre...\n\n* **Prompt:** Check with Eureka.\n\n**Chief:** Eureka? Why are you here? Wait, are you the one fixing all the gear in the rec area?\n\n**Eureka:** Yep, that's me. I've been working on the karaoke machine, the photo booth, and even the library door—all at Miss Faye's request.\n\n**Eureka:** I've repaired them all, but people keep sending in repair requests, so I had to come and see for myself. But Chief, you see it too, right? Everything's functioning perfectly...\n\n**Chief:** I'm still not sure what's going on. Maybe we should give the photo booth a whirl and see if it's actually working?\n\n**Eureka:** Okay, firing it up... Ah, this pose works, selecting...

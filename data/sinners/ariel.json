After such crimes were exposed, the subject intentionally obstructed the [[[Framework Against Catastrophe |FAC's]]] law enforcement and even assaulted FAC officials with special power. Although no casualties resulted, the subject's refusal to comply with an identity check suggests other intentions for the coverup of Maniacs, and stricter interrogations are thus required.\n\n--\n\nThe subject has been identified as the daughter of the Spencer family after her arrest. Interrogation reveals that the subject harbored Mania patients entirely out of sympathy and //excessive charity//.\n\nDue to her special identity, the Bureau has attempted a negotiation with the Spencers. All in all, the family seems to have already given up on the subject, so she'll be officially put under the MBCC's management from now on.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\n\r\nThe balls of light released with the power speed up the refilling of energy gaps in cells, accelerating small wound recovery in the target organism as well as curing most physical injuries and diseases.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\n\r\nDuring frequent contact with maniacs, the body's self-preservation instinct kicked in and unconsciously induced an awakening in the subject.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\n\r\nThe corruption level is low.

Then the one in the coffin is...\"\n\"The Saintess! The Saintess has been resurrected! She will surely forgive us!\"","interrogation1":"Although Ariel appears meek and naive, the Chief doesn't rule out the possibility that she might be dangerous, asking why she interfered with FAC operations. Ariel, apologetic, describes how FAC operatives cornered and harassed a young Maniac girl. Filled with a strong desire to protect her, Ariel awakened as a Sinner, using her powers to buy the girl time to escape. The Chief brings up the Spencer family's hostile stance against Mania, to which Ariel replies that she doesn't think people should be judged based on class or health. As she continues on the topic of her father, she spirals into self-loathing, but the Chief assures her that her abilities will be a great help to DisCity. Ariel asks the Chief to repeat what they said, and the Chief once again affirms that she isn't a liability to others. Ariel breaks down crying, saying she's never been told anything like this, and realizes that she can exist for her own sake instead of for the Spencers. After settling down, she asks the Chief if she can go see her father.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Do \"Sins\" really equal \"Sinners\"? This question had a new answer when Ariel showed up. Perhaps this seemingly spoiled girl hailing from a rich family has a heart clearer and more resolute than anyone else.</i></p>","interrogation2":"The Chief takes Ariel to the Spencer estate in the guise of a local sheriff, cautioning her against revealing their identity or her own as a Sinner. Ariel suspects that her father, Ganson, won't care about the fact that she's been missing for days. Indeed, Ganson shows no concern about the state of her health, and it soon becomes clear that he only values her for her ability to benefit the family name. In a last ditch effort to get his recognition, Ariel creates a glowing orb with her Sinner abilities. Ganson immediately becomes hostile, disowning her and threatening to shoot her. The Chief tries to stand up for Ariel to no avail, watching as Ganson fires on his own daughter. One shot hits Ariel in the shoulder, causing her powers to run wild. She deflects a second shot with the ball of light and instinctively knocks the gun from Ganson's hand. Ganson takes this as more evidence for Sinners' violent nature, and the wounded Ariel ushers the Chief outside. She asks if the Chief could make her father believe that she died from the gunshot wound. The Chief asks her if this was her intent all along, and Ariel passes out from blood loss before she can reply.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Ariel's father is more cold-hearted and extreme than you expected. Apparently, Ariel was anticipating her father to react that way. She is here this time not to visit her family but to bid them farewell.</i></p>","interrogation3":"As the two stand over Ariel's tombstone, Ariel thanks the Chief for issuing her obituary. With the procession still off in the distance, she wonders if her father feels guilty about what he did, and if that she, too, has a despicable side, having used such extreme measures to get his attention. The Chief assures her that what she did is nothing compared to Ganson's ruthlessness. They then apologize for being suspicious of her back in the interrogation room, and Ariel replies that she simply thought they would believe her if she was truthful. Noticing the procession approaching, the Chief tells Ariel that they should leave. Ariel, after a final long look at the estate, says that they should go home.\r\n\r\nLater, the Chief informs Ariel that the girl she saved, Shan, managed to escape safely to Syndicate. Ariel, now assisting the medical team, is ecstatic that she finally managed to help someone, only to hear a crack from one of the test tubes she mistakenly put in the freezer.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The FAC didn't make it explicit, but they agreed with your decision. The Spencers and the rescued Maniacs stay out of this. Behind this seemingly happy ending, the only victim is Ariel who has to leave behind her family name and everything in the past, trying to start a new life in a hurry.</i></p>","arrestRec1":" Awakened while resisting the FAC's law enforcement. Unable to control their power at the time, the subject was easily subdued and immediately escorted to the [[[Minos Bureau of Crisis Control |MBCC]]] for further investigation.","arrestRec2":"The subject has hosted or taken part in over a hundred charity events since childhood and has a good reputation in Eastside. Many used to come specifically to claim relief materials after hearing about the beauty and kindness of the young Miss Spencer.","arrestRec3":"The youngest daughter of the prestigious Spencer family, the subject has many elder siblings. She has received aristocratic private education since childhood and has dipped into the piano, dance, and painting, yet is versed in none. The subject therefore had a low status in the family and was often neglected.","arrestRec4":"The subject doesn't wish to affect the family with her Sinner identity and has forsaken the family name, merely joining the MBCC as the Chief's assistant. Kept in the dark, the Spencer family mistook that the subject had died and held a grand funeral, which many of the Eastside's rich and powerful attended to mourn her passing.","servingTerm1":"The subject has lost her way multiple times in the Bureau. Once, the subject intruded into the [[[Chief |Chief's]]] private space accidentally and was so mortified by it that she requested punishment. After the staff customized a map for the subject, she seems to get lost less often now.","servingTerm2":"Has no concept of money and once spent close to ten thousand DisCoins on bird food to save frail birds. Feeling deeply guilty after knowing about the difficulties it brought to the Supply Office, the subject voluntarily took up first-aid duties and promised to overachieve to compensate for it.","servingTerm3":"Thoughts on the subject are polarized among the Sinners. Most people appreciate her kind and easygoing nature, but a small number of Sinners are annoyed by her excessive sympathy and feel humiliated by it.","servingTerm4":"The subject's father has had multiple negotiations with the MBCC to regain his daughter's custody, but the subject has rejected the requests personally. According to some staff, Ariel turned down her father's requests because she'd rather stay beside the Chief than become a tool for political marriage.","emotionCheck1":"[Now that the mission is over, Ariel comes to apologize to you.]\r\n\r\n**Ariel:** I think I am… always a burden to everyone...\r\n\r\n**Chief:** ......\r\n\r\n* **Prompt:** Keep up the good work.\r\n * **Ariel:** Sorry… I'll double the effort.\r\n * **Ariel:** 😫\r\n\r\n* **Prompt:** You give everyone power.

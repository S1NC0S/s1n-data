She's adept at blending in, winning over her targets, and achieving her goals. Her actions have deep ties, implicating many top figures. We need to bring her in for questioning right away.\n\n--\n\nUpon close examination, we learned that a tragic family event has fueled a strong resentment and mistrust for the FAC's top brass. This drove her to team up with the Garden, seeking a chance for payback. Additionally, she's become overly protective of her loved ones, showing an intense desire to shield them. However, since being brought in and experiencing the soothing environment of the Bureau, combined with Chief's comforting words, she's cooled down and seems to have found a new place where she belongs.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThe subject can easily stab the needle into any part of an object. Once the ability kicks in, the items begins to degrade by Mania starting from where the needle touched, crumbling away to nothing. The subject decides how fast and how much it corrodes.

But given the subject's knack for disguise and strong mental composure, it's tough to gauge if the subject's grappling with deep-seated psychological issues. Still, the occasional hints of paranoia hint that the chaos left an enduring mark on the subject's psyche.","ecbFlavourText":"\"Don't... don't leave me...!\"","interrogation1":"Garofano is arrested as the primary suspect for the murder of her husband, Mr. Braun, who was killed after being impaled with a poisoned needle. Upon discovery that she is a Sinner, she is transferred to the MBCC for custody while awaiting her trial. While reviewing the case files, the Chief notices that the investigation was conducted quickly and shoddily, concluding her guilt as soon as they discovered that she was a Sinner. The Chief decides to interrogate Garofano, not because they believe in her innocence, but in order to be sure that due process is done. Garofano explains that she was never really married to Braun; rather, he took her in after her family was killed in a Mania incident, and they formed a partnership so that she could take care of him in his old age. Garofano appeals to the Chief’s sympathy by claiming that she has already experienced what it is like to lose her loved ones, and would never want that again. She also claims that, unlike was is stated in the Chief’s case files, she did not stand to inherit anything from Braun’s death, and that his inheritance will now transfer to his younger brother. The Chief remains unconvinced that she is innocent, but commits to filing an application to delay her trial while they look further into her case.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Through Garofano's heartfelt confession, you learn about her untold truths and the grief of losing her loved ones. Compelled by her story, you vow to get to the bottom of the ase and clear her name.</i></p>","interrogation2":"The Chief receives a call from the [[[Public Security Bureau]]] requesting that they retract their application and allow Garofano’s trial to take place on the original date. Finding this suspicious, the Chief refuses and reiterates their responsibility to fully investigate any case involving Sinners. They go to Garofano’s cell and ask her about Braun’s brother; she explains that the brothers had a difficult relationship due to the younger's gambling habit. He also hated Garofano, but she confusedly recounts how he had recently ordered a custom suit from her tailor shop, come in for several appointments, but then never picked up the finished garment. [[[Nightingale |Nightingale's]]] investigation reveals that the PSB officer in charge of the case and the official who did the autopsy on Mr. Braun are both closely affiliated with Braun's younger brother, and had even ordered the poison that was used in his murder. \n\nWith this information, the Chief is able to present the evidence to the court and prove Garofano's innocence. They tell Garofano that her name has been cleared, but also break the news that that doesn't mean she can return to her former life. Because she is a Sinner, she still must stay within the MBCC's detention. Garofano takes this well, saying that she has already begun to feel like the Bureau is her new home; she gets along well with the other Sinners, doing things for them like repairing Hella's knit hat. She requests that if she is to stay at the Bureau, that she first go with the Chief to retrieve some objects and materials from her old shop.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>As the truth shatters past misconceptions, new connections emerge. You not only help Garofano reclaim her reputation but also welcome her as part of your family.</i></p>","interrogation3":"Garofano and the Chief return to her tailor shop, but are unexpectedly attacked by a gang of thugs led by Braun's brother. They flee out the back, but the Chief is shot in the arm with a Mania bullet. Garofano treats their wound, and the Chief urges her to run and call for backup while the Chief holds off their pursuers. However, they quickly become paralyzed as Garofano reveals that she dressed their wound with an immobilizing poison. She confesses that she is an operative of the Garden, and quickly murders their pursuers while the Chief watches in horror.\n\nGarofano tells the Chief that she first came to the Bureau to get revenge for the way that the MBCC detains Sinners. However, upon meeting the Chief, she was impressed by their compassion for their detainees. She says that the Chief told her the MBCC could be her new family, and that all she's doing now is protecting her family. She seems hurt that the Chief doesn't trust her after realizing that she is from the Garden, but the Chief doesn't budge. Garofano decides that if they are wary of her true face, that she should revert back to the version of her that the Chief did trust, and readily agrees to go back to the Bureau.\n\nBack in confinement, Garofano again shows no sign of her alter ego as a merciless assassin. When the Chief visits her again, they confess that they can't trust her as long as they don't know if she's telling the truth. Garofano replies that maybe everything she had said before was true, and that the best deceptions blend both truth and lies. She says that she could have saved her siblings when her father became a Corruptor, but she hesitated and lost the chance -- thus, she never hesitates to use extreme methods. Garofano acknowledges that the Chief can't tell her now whether or not they'll be able to trust her in the future, but she hopes that they will have an answer for her soon.\n\nIt is revealed that this conversation takes place on March 13 of NF 113, the day before the Chief went on a mission to investigate to remains of [[[BR-004]]] in [[[Syndicate]]]. They did not return, as [[[Rustfire]]] rebellion began shortly after, and the Chief was martyred, fell into a coma and was believed dead. The following month, Garofano escaped from the Bureau and went missing.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>A skilled seamstress, a kind-hearted widow, a member of the Garden...

But when Younger Mr. Braun claimed she was behind her husband's death, a wave of skepticism swept the community. Yet, the moment her secret life as a Sinner came to life, all the supporting voices disappeared overnight.","arrestRec3":"According to the subject's statement, her home had once been subjected to a sudden and catastrophic Mania attack.

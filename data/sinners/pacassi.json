Storing an excessive amount of nuclear energy in the body, the subject frequently emits dangerous radiation and has a record of annihilating the entire town of Mayek.

The subject must be isolated and strictly controlled to minimize the destructive threat to society.\n\n--\n\nInvestigation reveals that the disaster in Mayek was not caused by the subject but an inhabitant who insisted on relaunching the damaged nuclear power plant. The subject has also revealed during interrogation that her only wish is to pass on her memories of Mayek.

Warnings from the RRI indicate that emotional fluctuations can cause her ability to rapidly increase radiation output, leading the Chief to don protective gear for her interrogation. Pacassi is calm and cooperative as the Chief questions her about her ability and her life in Mayek, and claims to feel physically great ever since becoming a Sinner. When the conversation turns to Mayek's destruction, Pacassi is cagey about explaining how it came about, but says that the power plant explosion was not entirely an accident. Pacassi claims it was her fault, but the Chief suspects that she is covering for the town's mayor and her surrogate parent, Longyear. They tell her that Mayek is gone and there is no need for her to protect anything or anyone there, which upsets her; she cries that it's still her home, and she was unable to save it. To the Chief's surprise, and in contradiction to the Ring Research Institute's warnings, the Chief realizes that her emotional outburst has not caused any increase in the amount of radiation Pacassi emits. The Chief tries to comfort her, but decides that the best course of action for now is to give her some space.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>After a hundred years, the term that no one dares mention has been brought up again — \"nuclear\". It was once an indispensable source of energy, but it too was the apocalypse that devastated our cities. And now, it sits silently in front of you.</i></p>","interrogation2":"Pacassi has settled in to the MBCC and is calm, reliable and pleasant at all times, but remains distant from her peers and spends most of her time alone. The Chief approaches her while she’s reading a history of DisCity and asks her about the history of her own hometown. Pacassi explains that Mayek was once a city of 500,000, and that it was able to survive easily for some time after [[[Nightfall]]] thanks to its nuclear power plant. However, 30 years ago, the power plant broke down for the first time, and Mayek’s population either died in the cold winter or left the city in large numbers. Pacassi’s parents left when she was 4 years old, and she was adopted by Longyear, becoming his assistant on running and maintaining the plant. It continued to degrade nonetheless, and for the last two years before the disaster, it did not run at all. Pacassi purchased a [[[Hypercube]]] from a traveling merchant from DisCity, with which she was able to easily repair the plant. But when Longyear found out, he was enraged and destroyed the device. The remainder of the Mayek’s population left after that, including Pacassi, but when snow began to fall she took pity on the old man and returned. She found Longyear asleep in the control room with the plant overheating, passed out, and does not remember anything until she woke up in DisCity.\n\nThe Chief tries to tell her that Longyear made his choice to protect Pacassi’s future, but she says that she doesn’t want a future where Mayek and Longyear are forgotten. She thanks the Chief for their kindness in listening to her and providing her with a comfortable life, and then leaves.\n\n//Pacassi left the sports ground. She is like a chunk of ice, never melting and encasing Mayek's numerous memories.\nAll of Mayek's memories belong to her and only her.//","interrogation3":"The Chief takes Pacassi out of the Bureau for a walk around Eastside. She is uncomfortable by the size and number of people in the enormous city, and reluctant to come along, but the Chief convinces her to go with them to a restaurant owned by one of the Mayekans who emigrated when Pacassi was young. They reveal that all those who came to DisCity have retained their culture and are still in touch with each other, but Pacassi is resistant to meeting them again. Finally, the Chief brings her to a building where they are beginning to construct a museum dedicated to Mayek’s history, complete with parts salvaged from the original power plant. Pacassi finally becomes emotional and accepts the Chief’s support, glad that the city and its people will not be forgotten.\n\n//You tour for a long time in Eastside and visit many places that Pacassi has never been to.\nMayek's memories don't belong to Pacassi alone anymore. They shall not be forgotten. Instead, more and more people will remember them.//","arrestRec1":"During a search mission in reaction to an abnormal energy reading in the Mayek region, the subject was rescued from under the rubble and transferred to the MBCC for supervision.","arrestRec2":"Rescued and sheltered in the DisCity after a nuclear reactor disaster at thirteen and had previously lived in the town of Mayek. Records show that the subject's parents emigrated years ago, but their exact current location was unknown and the subject appeared to have been adopted by Mayek.","arrestRec3":"The subject has extensive knowledge of machinery operation and is an expert at repairing and creating various intricate machinery and electrical devices. It's believed that the subject has years of relevant working experience as an assistant.","arrestRec4":"Assisted the town mayor Longyear in the repairs of Mayek's power plant. The construction resulted in a total failure due to Longyear's forceful launch of the power plant. The hydrogen explosion caused by the failure was the main factor that led to the nuclear energy build-up in the town and its eventual destruction.","servingTerm1":"Usually highly cooperative in all physical examinations, will agree to different sorts of investigation requests unconditionally, and able to give objective updates on own radiation sickness.

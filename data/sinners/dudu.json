In these five years, she has committed many crimes in DisCity, like business fraud and conducting business without a license. She is the bane of the lives of the Syndican citizens.\n\nDudu helped Oak Casket traffic in contraband, and then helped cover up Oak Casket's criminal activities. This is a serious crime; she must be detained immediately.\n\n--\n\nAs an Outlander, the subject was a nomad prior to detention and had a rough lifestyle. In the highly unstable environment in Syndicate, she already chose the least harmful way to make a living.\n\nAfter being detained by the MBCC, her life has greatly improved. She also uses her power to aid Sinner missions. The subject's power provides effective assistance and she has played a key role in several missions.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nDudu uses sound waves to stimulate the secretion of adrenalin, a substance that enhances one's self-healing ability and physical strength. By concentrating her mind, she can direct her power at a specific person.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nDudu got caught in a gang war when she was a teenager, and was infected with Mania after being exposed to the Mania weapons used in the war. The infection was worsened by her prolonged exposure to the corpses of Corruptors, and she eventually awakened her power.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nThe physical examination conducted by the MBCC on Dudu shows that the results for each item except //severity of infection// are within the normal range; Dudu suffers from a low level of Maniac corruption, but no abnormalities have been found on her body, and her mental status is relatively stable.","ecbFlavourText":"\"May misfortunes be gone and confusion be broken. May you part with pain, find happiness, and gain eternal bliss.\"","interrogation1":"Since being brought to the Bureau, Dudu has been an insufferable menace, playing suona at all hours and becoming the source of dozens of noise complaints. The Chief confronts her about this in the interrogation room, threatening to confiscate her suona if she doesn't comply. Dudu lashes out uncharacteristically, snapping that she was never judged for pursuing her passion in Drifter Camp. Seemingly attempting to get them to inquire further, the Chief relents and asks about the goings on, to which Dudu replies in remarkably comprehensive detail. Although the Chief is impressed, this turns out to be nothing more than another of Dudu's ploys, her goal being to return to Drifter Camp as an \"intelligence agent.\" Though they refuse, the Chief still strikes up a bargain with her, saying that as long as she adheres to noise regulations, they will have the MBCC's intelligence agents personally share all info relating to Drifter Camp with her. Dudu agrees and skips cheerily out of the room.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Dudu demonstrates her thorough knowledge of the Drifter Camp during the interrogation. Despite refusing her request to release her back to the Drifter Camp, you promise to share some of the information you pry out of the camp. In exchange, Dudu agrees to obey the Bureau's rules.\nFinally, the problem troubling you for days is solved.</i></p>","interrogation2":"A few days later, Dudu barges into the Chief's office, claiming that someone in Drifter Camp has information on Parma. Although suspicious, the Chief immediately mobilizes a unit, only to find a senile old woman alone in her apartment. Dudu insists that she is in fact the source of intel, and after being prompted, the woman starts to mumble about \"Pa… ma…\", as well vague places such as \"the old elm tree\" and \"the chicken coop.\" After suddenly shooing them out of her home, Dudu explains that the woman's dementia has worsened since the growth of her brain tumor, having actually requested that Dudu be the one to perform her funeral rites. The Chief doubts that the woman was actually saying \"Parma,\" having almost heard a third, middle syllable, but Dudu laughs off the accusation, dragging Chief around Drifter Camp instead.\n\nThe Chief learns from the locals that Dudu has been cleaning for the old woman in recent months. As the day goes on, Dudu is shown to be much beloved by the Drifter Camp, and shares that others have been caring for the woman as well in spite of her temperament. Just as the Chief is about to conclude the trip, Dudu directs them to the home of an old man, who reveals that the \"Pa… ma…\" the old woman spoke of is actually \"Palama.\" According to him, Palama supposedly can be found in an uninhabited building, which years ago was the subject of a local tragedy after it was struck by lightning. Dudu admits that she knew there was no Parma intelligence, but the Chief dismisses her concerns, saying that she would have allowed Dudu to return had they known her reason. Having come this far, the two decide to investigate Palama anyways, with Dudu hoping she might be able to bring the old woman some peace in her final days.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The so-called lead about// Parma //is indeed just a pretext Dudu has made up for going back to the Drifter Camp to visit a severely ill old lady. But guided by Dudu, you interact with the residents there and observe their customs and habits up close, making quite a few useful discoveries.\nHowever, just when you're about to go home, you learn from the local elderly that the old lady's mind has been occupied by something named// Palama. //The truth about everything seems to hide in an abandoned building destroyed in a disaster.</i></p>","interrogation3":"As they explore the building, Dudu shares some of her past. She explains that the song she plays, the Song of the Phoenix, was taught to her by her suona teacher, and can be played for both the living and dead. When the Chief asks about how her teacher is now, she reveals that he died during a gang shooting some time after they came to DisCity.\n\nThe two find some of the old woman's belongings, including a photo and diary belonging to her grandson, the aforementioned Palama. The diary reveals that he was one of the casualties in the lighting strike incident, and that the woman had been visiting him up until her dementia began to worsen. Dudu solemnly asks that they return them to the old woman, and the Chief agrees. Upon arriving at her home, however, they find that she passed peacefully in her sleep. As requested, Dudu plays her a funeral dirge. Afterwards, Dudu says that her teacher told her that death is not the end, but rather that being forgotten is. The Chief reassures her that as long as the two of them remember their tale, the old woman and Palama will live on.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Palama is in fact the old lady's grandson who died years ago. When you arrive at her home with the photo and diary she left in the abandoned building, she's already had her last breath in her dream.\nAs promised, Dudu plays a suona tune for her for the last time. Just as Dudu's master once said, death is not the end of life, forgetting is. The story of the old lady and Palama will live on in your memories.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"The Chief meets Dudu on the way to Syndicate for a rescue mission. At the early stage of the mission, the Chief works with Dudu and learns about the existence of Oak Casket from her. When the mission is completed, Dudu, wishing to be around Oak Casket, decides to go to the MBCC with the Chief and agrees to be detained.","arrestRec2":"Dudu once joined a ceremonial band that worked for a gang, but the band broke up after the gang was wiped out. Dudu, now without a stable job, drifts around in Syndicate and, thanks to Oak Casket, plays at funerals and in banquets here and there.","arrestRec3":"Dudu's power is highly stimulating to life beings. Since she awakened her power, Dudu has been based in Syndicate, where she has stirred up many gang wars and civil unrest. Most often than not, Dudu creates confusion as a distraction from her smuggling activities.","arrestRec4":"Dudu is an unregistered Outlander who came to Syndicate from a satellite city located far away. She was taken in by a troupe when she was a kid and entered Syndicate illegally with the troupe. Later on, the troupe was annihilated in a large gang war where Mania weapons were used, with Dudu being the only survivor.","servingTerm1":"The MBCC didn't confiscate Dudu's Suona when she was detained. And now she plays it on and off the clock, whenever it pleases her. Once, the MBCC received 118 complaints about Dudu's Suona playing in one day, both from the other Sinners and MBCC staffers.","servingTerm2":"Dudu has a strong opinion about the food in the MBCC cafeteria. She once mounted a protest by eating nothing but steamed rice mixed with soy sauce and chili paste for a whole month, but called it quit when nothing came of it. At the moment, she is cultivating good relations with the cafeteria staffers, trying to earn herself a chance to cook. ","servingTerm3":"No one wants to live next to Dudu's room, except for Oak Casket. Other than that, Dudu gets along well enough with the other Sinners. She once went stargazing with Stargazer, and they read each other's palms. ","servingTerm4":"When the Chief successfully lessens Oak Casket's Maniac symptoms, Dudu becomes more trusting of the Chief, and starts to rein in her unruliness and becomes nicer to the Chief. \"The food in your cafeteria is atrocious. You hungry? Would you like me to make a bowl of noodles for you?\" she once said to the Chief. ","emotionCheck1":"[Dudu comes out of the kitchen with a plate full of fried pork chops.]\r\n\r\n**Dudu:** Hey, boss.

After a few practices, I realized no one could match my suona, so we disbanded.\n\n* **Prompt:** Comfort her\n\n**Chief:** Don't feel too bad about it.

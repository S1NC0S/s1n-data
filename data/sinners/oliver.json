A clerk reports that the target has entered a certain building in [[[Eastside]]], suspected to be their home. [[[Chief]]] overhears the conversation and recognises Oliver as the target. Using their propensity for abusing the sympathy of wealthy people, Chief comes up with a plan to capture Oliver, and heads out. A brief cutaway to a dilapidated basement reveals Oliver to be speaking to their Aunt and Cousin. In the next scene, it is noted by MBCC intelligence that Oliver‚Äôs Uncle, Aunt, and Cousin have all stopped going to work and school for many years, yet neighbours say that they always see the family happy together through the windows. Thus, Chief knocks on the door to begin the infiltration and seek the truth. Oliver, initially annoyed by Chief‚Äôs request for assistance, is fooled by Chief‚Äôs expensive attire and allows them in.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>As expected, the ‚Äúlittle trickster‚Äù that has been giving the officers a headache is Oliver. You‚Äôve located Oliver‚Äôs residence, and now you‚Äôre just waiting for the plan to take effect.</i></p>\n","interrogation2":"Chief surveys the home and concludes that it has not been cared for for many years. They sense a Mania-like scent, and notice a door left ajar. Oliver gets Chief to sit and begins telling a story of their parents having passed and being abused by their relatives, subtly seeking for Chief‚Äôs sympathy. Chief tells Oliver that if they truly are a good child, Chief would be happy to help them escape from there and buy them the best toy in Eastside. Oliver, seemingly appeased by this, agrees to fetch a glass of water for Chief.\n\nWith the window of opportunity, Chief heads into the basement. They discover three ‚Äòmannequins‚Äô, but realises that they are in fact humans. Oliver appears, holding an empty glass; they had not been fooled. They had recognised Chief as the rag doll from [[[Eve |Buonanotte Toy Factory]]], and commands the three human bodies to move with their Sinner power. Oliver attempts to attack Chief, but Chief releases the [[[Shackles]]] and successfully contains them. This marks the first known time that Chief is able to use the shackles at a distance. Freed from the child‚Äôs control, Oliver‚Äôs relatives curse at them, and Oliver curls up on the floor with their beloved unicorn toy.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Discrepancies have been resolved, and amidst lies and deception, you‚Äôve found the truth. This mistreated child has already taken vengeance, using even more extreme measures.</i></p>\n","interrogation3":"A flashback shows Oliver‚Äôs mother telling them to behave while living with their relatives, and apologising for leaving them with nothing.\n\nAfter the arrest, Oliver is brought back to the MBCC and left in solitary confinement for a few days to calm down. When they become more stable, Chief decides to interrogate them. Oliver denies that they scammed any adults, stating that they had all chosen to help them voluntarily. Chief points out that the Bureau‚Äôs doctor had examined Oliver‚Äôs wounds and confirmed that they were self-inflicted. They also produce the fake [[[the homeless |Homeless]]] badges left behind by Oliver as further evidence of Oliver‚Äôs crimes.\n\nChief finally persuades Oliver to tell the truth, and the child angrily vents about how they had been mistreated by their relatives. However, as they had promised his mother to get along with their relatives, their power manifested in a way where they could force their abusers to play ‚Äòhappy family‚Äô with them. Seeing that Oliver feels no remorse, Chief pretends to leave, guilt-tripping Oliver about how the unicorn toy (an emotional stand-in for their mother) would feel hearing what they had just said. A flashback reveals that their mother had given them the unicorn toy, as well as a priceless opal necklace to hide inside it. Finally breaking down into tears, Oliver admits that they resorted to those methods as their relatives had accumulated a huge gambling debt, and had tried to take their mother‚Äôs necklace to sell. Up till then, they had endured their abuse by telling himself they would be able to leave and support themselves when they grew up.\n\nSome time later, Oliver is seen calling out to Nightingale. They initially wish to pass a message to Chief, but Oliver becomes dejected as they wonder if they might be a ‚Äòbad child‚Äô (by bothering Chief). Nightingale says that Chief actually has something to give to them; Oliver is shocked by a huge, colourful toy, and starts crying out of happiness as Chief kept their promise.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Within the battered unicorn toy, a glimpse of hope yet remains, its heart as clear and precious as a gem. This is Oliver‚Äôs most treasured possession.</i></p>\n","arrestRec1":"He was arrested by a Eastside sheriff on charges of intentional assault and fraud. His identity as a Sinner was exposed during his escape and was therefore brought back by MBCC field guards.","arrestRec2":"Both of Oliver's parents were accidentally killed when Oliver was a little child. Oliver's aunt adopted Oliver as the last kin. Instead of a healthy upbringing, Oliver is treated harshly in aunt's home.","arrestRec3":"The aunt's family, who are in a bad and declining financial situation, not only tries to abandon Oliver but also repeatedly covets the only relic left by Oliver's mother. Oliver fights back against the aunt's family in an overzealous attempt to protect the relic.","arrestRec4":"Oliver's living conditions even improved after the loss of all relatives. According to the investigation, Oliver often intentionally roamed the streets of Eastside, picking out targets to lie to for sympathy. After one of the lies was exposed, Oliver fled alone to the border between Eastside and the Rust to escape capture, and was accidentally caught up in a series of incidents at a toy factory.","servingTerm1":"The subject is a picky eater whose preferences are dictated by the mood at the moment. For the sake of the Sinner's health, the MBCC cafeteria has no choice but to tailor special meals.","servingTerm2":"Oliver will pretend not to understand if a staff member makes a direct request in a commanding tone. Oliver is willing to comply only when the staff uses words like \"please\", \"could you...\" and \"would you mind...\"","servingTerm3":"Although claimed to have become good friends with all other Sinners, Oliver in fact rarely initiates conversations with those from Syndicate. Only a few naive and wealthy Sinners from Eastside identify as Oliver's \"good friends.\" ","servingTerm4":"Once, Chief woke up with both hands and feet tied with a strand of silk.

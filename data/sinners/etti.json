The shop did brisk business, but was related to multiple missing customer cases.\n\nWhen she was confronted by Chief during the board game incident, the subject revealed the disastrous potential of her ability. It confirmed the suspicion of her confinement of multiple customers and immediate detention was thus required.\n\n--\n\nCurrently, under the MBCC's strict supervision, the subject consciously controls her power when organizing board game activities so as to ensure others' safety. As she spends more time with other Sinners and Chief, the subject has become less obsessed with rules and control and her excessive urge to escape reality has been curbed. She's become more trusting and approving towards real life, herself, and the people around her.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nWith her ability, she can reshape the atomic structure of any substance to turn it into an object she wants.

They find her sleeping, and take her into custody. She remains asleep for three days, recovering from the amount of energy expenditure necessary to create an entire fictional world. When she comes to, she is defiant and combative. However, the Chief is able to get her interest by engaging her in a roleplaying game. They give Etti a character sheet to fill out and begin a LARP adventure through the Bureau.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>As expected, Etti quickly accepts the invitation to the// game. //She fills out the character card and challenges you with a smile.

She encounters [[[Hella]]] and [[[Nintety-Nine]]], whom the Chief had previously recruited to be part of the game. The two of them have a bag of bread, which Etti will need to make it through the wasteland. She attacks them unprovoked, and Ninety-Nine awkwardly plays along as she pretends to be defeated. Hella fights back, but is easily dispatched. The Chief bends the rules to narrate the bread being knocked out of reach during the fight, and Ninety-Nine obediently throws it on top of the Bureau‚Äôs fence. At the Chief‚Äôs urging, Etti decides that the three of them will need to work together in order to survive the wilderness without food, and recruits Hella and Ninety-Nine to her party. She orders Ninety-Nine to destroy the fence in order to retrieve the bread, and the three escape from the Bureau together.\n\nFollowing behind the LARP, [[[Nightingale]]] and [[[KK | K.K.]]] look in despair at the extent of the destruction the game is causing on the MBCC‚Äôs facilities. \n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Guided by// fate, //Etti, Hella, and Ninety-Nine form an adventurer team.

Exploring the area, Etti and the others meet [[[EMP]]], who offers them information about the legendary castle that they‚Äôre seeking. However, Etti presumes that EMP is trying to swindle them and again launches an unprovoked attack. EMP dodges Ninety-Nine‚Äôs attack and strikes back, but Etti and Hella‚Äôs quick-thinking teamwork allow them to defeat her. Despite being beaten, EMP clarifies that she does actually have a clue about the castle, and requests to join the adventuring party.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The adventurer team defeats the// West District Overlord //EMP and takes her in.\nWith the message from EMP, Etti confirms that the instructions for the next step are kept by the merchant who sells her clues.</i></p>","interrogation4":"The Chief leads them to an art gallery which is supposed to contain the information broker where EMP received her clue, but they receive a message that [[[McQueen]]] got bored of waiting and left early. Improvising, the Chief has them search the premises and they uncover a clue revealing the location of the legendary castle. Etti excitedly leads the party towards the final stop of their adventure. The ‚Äúcastle‚Äù is a dark house in a remote part of Eastside. There, they fight the ‚ÄúDreadlord‚Äù, played by [[[list of minor characters |Wynn]]]. By working together, they defeat Wynn, and [[[Nightingale]]] reveals herself as the true final boss. She asks Etti to join her.

Etti rolls the better result and her power overwhelms the Chief‚Ä¶ until they wake up unharmed, back in the house in the real world. Etti reveals that she was pranking them as payback for the Chief‚Äôs shoddy game-mastering and showing them how it should really be done. The Chief congratulates Etti for clearing the game, and rewards her with a real treasure that they had found when searching her grandfather‚Äôs house after she was arrested: a letter from him, passing along his hopes that even after he was gone, she could continue to have fun with the games that the two of them had played together.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The dragon guards the magic box, in which darkness, tears, despair... and a small but brilliant glint of hope are locked.\nWithin the hope is everything everyone cherishes and will never forget.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"During the board game incident, Chief won Etti's game and successfully tore down her illusory realm. After the events, the subject was taken back to the MBCC by Chief where she was put under investigation and detention.","arrestRec2":"The subject's birth was an accident and her parents had no intention to raise her. She was left at her grandfather's door at birth. Growing up, she and her grandfather took care of each other. She had almost never met her irresponsible parents.","arrestRec3":"The lack of parental care and other external factors had made the subject extremely unsociable and lonely, so she began to immerse herself books and games.

She treasures and is very protective of their old house and memories about him. This is why she turned her home into the //game space// after awakening as a Sinner.

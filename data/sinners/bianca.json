Increases the max stacks of Bianca's P2 (which makes enemies take increased dmg from Bianca), and makes those stacks permanent. VS bosses, S1 is a 23.7% undiluted dmg up advantage over S0. In long battles, the value of S1 is even higher because S1 Bianca wont drop P2 stacks that S0 Bianca would, boosting S1 to a 135% dmg advantage over S0 for some portions of the battle.<br/><br/>**S3** - Provides conditional Physical Penetration. This can be a nice dmg increase, but the stacks are easily dropped and Pen is less valuable VS low DEF enemies."},{"title":"Notable Synergies","text":"**Shawn ★**<br/> Shawn is the only required Sinner (other than Bianca ofc) to play Weakspot team. Bianca has no way of applying WS herself. Shawn is needed for reliable WS application. S2 preferred.<br/><br/>**Golan**<br/>Golan is optional, but she can give a nice Physical dmg amp to Bianca with her P2, and she's also able to apply/remove WS. She has AoE Core dmg on her ECB Ult, but it can only be used twice per battle. S2 preferred.<br/><br/>**\"RBY\"**<br/>Staple meta BFL buffers: Cabernet, Enfer, OwO. Good support for Bianca in BFL.<br/><br/>**Lady Pearl**<br/>Lady Pearl is a strong DPS herself, and already a great flexible option in many teams. Although she's unable to apply WS, she synergizes well with Bianca because of her P2 and ECB Ult. All of Bianca's dmg is NA dmg. Lady Pearl's P2 provides a permanent 30% NA dmg increase and her ECB Ult provides a huge temporaty Atkspd buff for use during boss break window.<br/><br/>**Garofano**<br/>Although not recommended, Garofano is useable for WS team as she can apply/remove WS, and has some amp on her ECB. However, both her WS application and Core dmg are single target, and her amp is not as good as what the other aforementioned characters can provide. Garofano can work, but you would get more value out of running a meta buffer or sub-dps over her."}],"crimebrandSets":[{"name":"Embrace of the Dead","crimebrands":["embrace","embrace","embrace"],"note":"Increases damage dealt to broken enemies.

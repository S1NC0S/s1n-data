The subject killed her own father for some unknown reason during the process. Afterward, the subject spread the news about her father's mutation into a Corruptor and escaped the Public Security Bureau's arrest with the help of the dangerous Syndican organization //SALVA Hospital//. She also concealed a series of illegal experiments SALVA had been carrying out.\n\n--\n\nDocuments about the subject have been found in a special operation targeting illegal organizations. The analysis of the information reveals that the subject did not join the illegal activities fully on her own account. She was only misled by her father's improper education. Although for a long time, the subject did not have any basic concept of life and its value, her understanding of it has been significantly swerved under further education in her detention.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nAble to solidify blood bleeding out from the body into thorn-shaped crystallized spikes, causing indiscriminate damage within a linear range.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nAwakened at around seventeen.

The mental state is unstable with occasional nightmares and unconscious sleep-talking.\r\n","ecbFlavourText":"\"The nurse said that Daddy just went somewhere far, far away.\"\n\"What penetrated his chest?\"","interrogation1":"The Chief arrives in the interrogation room to an eager Victoria, overjoyed at the expressions of the Chief's love for her. Confused, the Chief asks what she means, and Victoria explains that 'love' is the feeling that someone feels when they want to keep someone like a caged bird; the enclosed room and monitoring equipment are all proof of this. In response, the Chief presents her with a list of staff testimonies: attempted force-feeding of dietary supplements, trapping Sinners in their rooms with blood crystals, and attacking employees with discarded syringes. They ask if these were all done out of the same kindness, and Victoria confirms, relieved that her expressions of love are finally being realized.\n\nThe Chief attempts to redefine the word for Victoria to no avail, as she is too clouded by the actions of her father, who locked her away and gave her various drugs and injections in the name of love. She says that she returned the favor when she pierced him through the chest with her blood crystals. This leads into the Chief's next piece of evidence - photos of a tortured Corruptor corpse - but Victoria is too deluded to properly answer, partially due to Anne telling her that her father simply went on a trip faraway, only alluding to the fact that her and her father took the same medicine together. She says that in return for giving her a photo of her father, she'll repay the Chief in kind. She bites her hand, launching blood crystals from the wound directly at them.\n\nThe Chief barely manages to avoid injury by activating the Shackles, disabling Victoria's powers, and explains that this was a last resort. While Victoria gushes about how the restrictions on her are being tightened, the Chief notices that the wound on her hand hasn't stopped bleeding. As color drains from her face, Victoria cheerily explains that her hemophilia is a gift from god. The Chief calls for medical help, much to Victoria's dismay, nor does she want the Shackles on her to be loosened. As she's being taken away, she laments that the interrogation is over, but that she's glad that the Chief will be here to keep her company until her father returns.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>According to the interrogation and subsequent investigation results, Victoria was born with poor immunity and her blood could not coagulate. To cure and protect her, Victoria's father resorted to extreme measures, locking Victoria to prevent her from getting in contact with anything or anyone in the outside world. Eventually, Victoria's father used the mechanic of awakening a Sinner to cure her illness, but he himself consumed the same unknown medicine and turned into a Corruptor. Having grown up in a secluded environment, Victoria mistook the meaning of love and slew her father after he became a Corruptor. But even after that, she continued to live under her psychopathic, paranoid father's shadow, causing her severe mental issues.</i></p>","interrogation2":"Victoria kidnaps the Chief, hiding them in medical storage depot within the Bureau, begging for them to once again use the shackles on her so she can feel 'her Daddy's warmth.' The Chief's protests fall on deaf ears as Victoria attempts to force more medication on them, her desperation growing as the Chief continues to plead with her to change her perception of love. Eventually, Nightingale arrives with reinforcements, but Victoria seals the door with her blood crystals. As Victoria closes in on the Chief, Nightingale blasts through the door with a breaching charge, and the screen goes black.\n\nA few hours later, the Chief meets with Nightingale and Chameleon outside Victoria's cell, where it's revealed that Chameleon hypnotized Victoria to stop her from killing the Chief. With Victoria still trapped in sleep, Chameleon states that either the Chief can help her positively influence Victoria's subconscious or the FAC will execute the rogue Sinner for her assassination attempt. The Chief agrees to help. As they enter the cell, Victoria is mumbling peacefully in her sleep, repeating 'Daddy, Daddy' and 'Chief, Chief.'\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Victoria kidnapped you without anyone else knowing. It was a close call when Nightingale found you just in time. Victoria's attempts to hurt you bears no fruits. Chameleon the psychologist has her mental status under control for now, locking her in the dream of her subconscious. You must make a choice before the FAC intervenes.</i></p>","interrogation3":"Chameleon hypnotizes the Chief to sleep. In Victoria's dream, she has successfully killed the Chief, relishing in the feeling of the Shackles used against her as a final defense. The Chief follows her as she wanders back into the Bureau, encountering Ariel, Hella, Labyrinth, and Hecate, who all attempt to make her understand that death is final. Desperately ignoring them, Victoria dream-wanders into SALVA Hospital, where she asks Anne if the Chief and her father will ever come back. The image of Anne vanishes, replaced by Iron, who tells her that her 'love' is the reason that she is the only one left. The dream SALVA collapses, and Victoria stumbles, coughing up blood, distraught as she begins to realize the weight of her actions.\n\nAs the background fades into a white mist, the Chief finally manages to be heard. Victoria lights up, feeling reaffirmed that she knew the Chief would come back, but the Chief denies this, playing the final part necessary to make her understand. They tell Victoria that no one will come back for her because of her misplaced love, and Victoria, lost, weeps as she asks what the right way to love is. The Chief says that they and everyone will come back, but only if Victoria promises to always ask for consent and consider the other person's feelings before she tries to express her love for them. She asks if her father will also come back, but the Chief only asks if Victoria trusts them to be able to teach her the right way to love. Victoria agrees, and as the Chief begins to wake her up, they see flashes of Victoria's father telling her not to fear death, that it's just a faraway place that everyone, even her departed mother, will return from one day.\n\nWhen they both awake, they are back in the sterile ward together, and Victoria asks the Chief if they dislike her. The Chief says that they will always accept any gifts from her as long as they don't trouble others. Victoria realizes her usual methods no longer apply under this definition, so she makes a rose out of her own blood instead, which the Chief adamantly refuses.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Victoria awoke from her subconscious dream world. Her mental status is now stabilizing. You made a friendly gesture and promised Victoria that you would teach and guide her. And the FAC decided to let this go. The two of you now share the same fate. And you will have to figure out how to make her understand the meaning of \"love\" and the fact that her father has left her.</i></p>\n","arrestRec1":"During a mission, the MBCC accidentally discovered that the special SALVA patient was a Sinner on the wanted list. After an undercover investigation, the MBCC decided to arrest the subject. As the subject was physically weak, she did not attempt to orally defend herself or resist during the arrest.","arrestRec2":"Following up on the rumor concerning a Corruptor the subject had spread, a secret sterile chamber was discovered in her home, where a mummified Corruptor corpse was kept. The corpse's features match those of the subject's father. It appears that he had been confined and abused when still alive.","arrestRec3":"The subject's family is highly influential in the political world. After giving birth to Victoria, her mother died of complications from obstructed labor. The subject's father allegedly abused his authority to collude with a mysterious power and was eventually killed by the subject after mutating into a Corruptor.","arrestRec4":"Due to her weak immunity, the subject had never been in touch with the world outside the sterile chamber in her childhood. Having received a restrictive, distorted formative education from her father, the subject lacked a basic understanding of life and emotions. Later, the subject was transferred to SALVA as a special patient and received free medical assistance.","servingTerm1":"Avoids non-sterile environments whenever it's possible and must put on the special respirator from SALVA before she leaves the sterile chamber. To save the MBCC's staff unnecessary trouble, the subject rarely goes out.","servingTerm2":"The subject doesn't possess regular common sense gained from real-life experience, so she often makes misjudgments due to her distorted moral values. As she continues to communicate with others, this discrepancy between her mental age and physical age is gradually lessening. ","servingTerm3":"Often raises philosophical questions to other Sinners. Though the subject has no ill intention, the people who get asked tend to feel like they've taken a hit in their brains and will begin to doubt their entire existence. ","servingTerm4":"Once tried to perceive life by keeping small animals as pets, but got stopped by the staff due to the cruelty of the process. Recently, the subject has been preying on plants instead and still refuses to give up after already causing the death of more than a dozen plants. Apparently, she wants to grow a white rose to express her love for the Chief.

They hear a sad and lonely voice singing from a distant building. Their way is blocked by a monster murmuring about how it needs to keep others away from its daughter. The Chief vanquishes it and continues forward. Children in the garden bargain with them, trading flowers and butterflies and playing guessing games to help them move closer to their destination.\n\nWhen the Chief reaches the building, they find it to be a shabby-looking hospital. Victoria is inside; she at first mistakes the Chief for her Daddy, but is quickly disappointed. She wants him to take her out to see the roses, but when the Chief offers to take her in his stead, she ruefully says that she's been told to stay where she is. He told her that it was dangerous outside, but that he will eventually return to give her a special present.\n\nThe Chief tells Victoria that her father is not coming back. They give her the thorn from their palm and tell her that he is waiting for her. Victoria is upset and afraid, but makes up her mind to go find him. She reaches out to the monsters in the garden, and the Chief must pull her back and tell her that they are not her Daddy.\n\nThey reach the headstone where the Chief began, and Victoria thrusts the metal thorn into the dirt. It blooms into a vibrant rose, and Victoria takes off her mask to breathe in its fragrance.\n//This is the world outside the window.//\n\n//She smells the fragrance of roses.//\n\n//The pure white monster,//\n\n//now,//\n\n//buried in a sea of flowers.//","baseVoicelines":"[Obtain the Sinner]\nMy name is Victoria.

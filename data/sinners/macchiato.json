Worsens Eastside's crime-filled atmosphere as a terrible influence on the city.\n\n--\n\nIt's stated in the file that multiple individuals involved in the illegal gatherings have a history of sexual harassment and assault, which matches the subject's statement. It's believed that after her special power awakened, the subject was unable to leave the fetish club due to the nature of her power, so she was essentially coerced into participation.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThose who get whipped will have their brain activities and hormones controlled.

Out of combat, she hides the whip somewhere less obvious. She tried changing weapons, but gave up as no other weapon came close to the efficiency of the whip in using her special powers.","servingTerm2":"Allowed to retain contact with her family in Eastside.

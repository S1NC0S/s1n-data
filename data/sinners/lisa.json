Each of the paintings is a replica. There they find Lisa, who is annoyed by their presence but also dismissive of the painted reproductions on the walls. At further investigation, they are unable to determine who painted the replicas in front of them; however, they come to realize that there are some alterations from the originals. Most notably, they all depict the same person. Lisa believes they are likely self-portraits, and sardonically wonders why somebody with so little talent would continue to paint so much.\n\nLisa notices that one of the paintings uses her signature coloring technique. She is embarrassed that her reputation could be associated with this output, but concedes that some elements of the paintings are improving over time. She still insists that the artist has no talent, but she concedes that they're not stupid and begins to show interest in seeing the rest of his work. Soon, she finds one that she recognizes ‚Äî though she can't remember who drew it, she remembers that something terrible happened in the studio where she saw it.\n\nA phantom appears. Lisa doesn't know who he is, and he laughs, saying that a tasteless soul like him isn't worthy of her remembrance, and then attacks. He seemingly rips her to shreds, and gloats at achieving its revenge for her humiliating it. Lisa reveals that that body was an illusion created by her ability, and she and the Chief flee through the gallery. A painting speaks to them, urging them to \"find the sun\" as the only way to defeat the phantom; Lisa seems to recognize the voice as that of her former student, Waylon.\n\nAnother painting whispers \"Endure, endure‚Ä¶\", and Lisa recalls that she once taught a replica painting class where she told the students that to become a true master, one must learn to endure loneliness. They find a painting depicting a sunflower, and as Lisa's butterflies touch it, bright light floods the gallery. It is revealed that the phantom is Waylon, who was inspired to begin painting after seeing Lisa's work. Although he wasn't skilled at it, he only wanted Lisa's approval. Lisa tells him that she doesn't regret her criticism of his work, but that if he had kept trying he may have eventually improved enough to impress her, and that he shouldn't harbor delusional expectations but should have kept believing in his own future even if nobody else did.\n\nDespite Lisa telling him to give up chasing her, Waylon insists that he needs Lisa's approval no matter what, and his body dissolves in the light. Lisa expresses some remorse at his loss, and hopes that the next time she ends up in that gallery she will see something worth her time.\n\n//The lonely shadow finally catches up to the light.//\n//It will disappear when touched, but she has no regrets.//\n//The butterfly flaps its wings.//\n//Shadows pass over the empty void.//\n//She is not unheard of, but simply a treasure without a name.//","baseVoicelines":"[Obtain the Sinner]\nArresting someone without evidence?

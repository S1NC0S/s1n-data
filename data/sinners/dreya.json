I'd like to know what had happened outside during the time I was asleep...\n\n**Chief:** Sure. Let's start with the foundation of DisCity then.\n\n**Dreya:** Okay.\n\n**Chief:** In N.F. 23, Dr. Keylan discovered the [[[Hypercube]]], a substance resistant to the catastrophe, and contained the spreading of the disaster. Two years later, [[[EDGE]]] was founded. Based on this agreement, mankind built DisCity and began mining Hypercubes.\n\n* **Prompt:** Talk about [[[Syndicate]]]\n\n**Chief:** Syndicate is part of DisCity. It was once the brightest gem on DisCity's crown at the peak of its mining industry.\n\n**Chief:** But since N.F. 84, due to the ruin of the DisSea mines and the fall of the mining industry, Syndicate's prosperity had quickly declined and it'd descended into disorder, slowly becoming a breeding ground for illegal gangs and crimes. Even today, violence and unrest are still rampant there.\n\n* **Prompt:** Talk about [[[Eastside]]]\n\n**Chief:** Eastside was founded later than Syndicate. It's a new commercial and entertainment district. After the [[[DisSea Explosion]]], enterprises from different sectors of the West District all began migrating to Eastside.\n\n**Chief:** Eastside has since grown into the most prosperous district of DisCity.

She nods.\n\n**Chief:** That's the Andromeda Galaxy 2.5 million light years away from Earth. When you look at it, the starlight that enters your eyes now was in fact emitted by the earliest ancestors of mankind.\n\n**Chief:** Perhaps the reason why we find the vast sea of stars mesmerizing is that it constantly reminds us of the unknown that's yet to be discovered and conquered on the other side of the universe.\n\n**Dreya:** ...How impressive.\n\n**Dreya:** Can you tell me more about the other stars?\n\n**Chief:** Sure.

Once again, neither of them can remember each other or themselves, but the Shackles bind them together and the Chief enters her mirage.\n\n[[[Keylan]]] offers the members of his expedition a final chance to back out, by they are all resolved to complete the mission. Another female member of the expedition supports Dreya as she struggles to walk in her hazmat suit. She says that their \"guide\" has taken them on a shortcut, and they are close to the [[[Perishing Star]]]. All the while, a faraway voice whispers in Dreya's ear that she should join it, because humanity is too weak to resist the change that is coming. Another team member tells her that he hears the voices too, but that their guide urges them to ignore it.\n\nAt the expedition's camp, Dreya reports that their research has hit a bottleneck. They have observed the Star from a distance for several days, and have picked up messages that may be coming either from Earth's past or future, but can't gather any solid date in the Black Ring. Dreya worries about the voices getting louder, and Keylan has to snap the expedition out of a trance as the murmuring overtakes them. He urges them to get some rest.\n\nDreya looks up at the stars and thinks about the night when she saw the Perishing Star approach the Earth. Unconsciously she begins walking towards the voice, but she is able to block them out and returns to her tent to sleep.\n\n[Phase 2]\n\nDreya comes to in the Research Institute, three years before the expedition. Her colleagues discuss the likelihood that the Perishing Star is not a normal celestial body, that it didn't come to Earth by chance, and that it's responsible for the catastrophes sweeping the world. Nevertheless, they are dismissive of the idea of an expedition to the Black Ring. Still, Dreya resolves to join Keylan's expedition, and a faraway voice praises her for not reacting to the unknown with fear, the way that most humans do.\n\nDreya's parents watch the tv, terrified by news of hundreds of soldiers dying in attempts to contain the contamination pouring out of DisSea. Dreya packs her suitcase, and she finds a celestial globe that she was given for her 9th birthday, which sparked her interest in astronomy. The words on Keylan's notice change to be an obituary about the deaths of the expedition team, and Dreya has a vision of her mother crying. The memory collapses and Dreya is back in the expedition, as the Perishing Star goes berserk and spews contamination. The rest of the team flees, but Dreya keeps walking toward it. A path opens up, leading her to the star. The Phantom Moon dawns over the DisSea for the first time.\n\n[Phase 3]\n\nDreya believes that by joining with the ultimate truth, she can learn how the Perishing Star is connected to the catastrophes destroying the world. The faraway voice urges her on and appeals to her sense of discovery, but the Chief's voice chimes in and tells her that she is a brilliant enough scientist on her own that she doesn't need the help of an evil entity. She hears snippets of old conversations with the many people who dismissed her interest in studying the star up close. Dreya resolves that it is *because* she is a small and insignificant human being that she came to the DisSea, facing challenges head on to find the truth. She takes the Chief's hand, and they give her a gift.\n\n[Phase 4]\n\nA young Dreya sits by the side of a lake beneath the starry sky. The Chief asks her about the Perishing Star, and although she acknowledges that harm it has brought, she also admits to being fascinated; she claims to be the one who discovered it. She says its her duty to uncover its secrets, and that she doesn't like being ignorant. She believes that every question in the world has an answer, and this is the biggest question that nobody has been able to answer; if she learns it's secrets, that would make her the most knowledgeable person in the world. The Chief promises that in the future she will be a great scientist.\n\nThe Chief thinks about how she, and many other scientists, will die in pursuit of the knowledge she desires. The Chief realizes that that is their destiny, and in doing so they will create hope for future generations. The Chief activates the Shackles and sinks into the lake, while a red star appears overhead.\n\n//No one can reach the unknown//\n//So, just like the others//\n//She becomes a star and guides the//\n//newcomers//","baseVoicelines":"[Obtain the Sinner]\nThe crimson full moon rises...

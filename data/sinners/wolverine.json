Soon after he was adopted by scavenger Hank, he ended up in the hands of a Syndican gang. He only gathered ingredients for Mania weapons and poached under the gang's coercion and threat.\n\nAfter breaking free from the gang, the subject has begun eliminating Corruptors voluntarily, in a way aiding the authority that manages the Rust's contamination.","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nThe crossbow and arrows are the normal Syndicate gang style.

Wolverine describes his role as a \"hunter\": he provides Corruptor remains for his former gang and in return they give him fresh meat. He states that he didn't know what the remains were being used for, nor does he hold the gang in especially high regard. He explains that that the gang groomed him for his role, with various members treating him like a literal dog, teaching him to track, forcing him to eat on the floor, and walking him on a leash. Eventually, they abandoned him at a critical moment to save their own lives, finding him some time later when they were once again in need of his services. The Chief asks more questions about Mania weapons, keen to find out who's behind the operation, and Wolverine becomes increasingly annoyed, apparently knowing nothing about the business end of the operation. Just before he makes to leave, the Chief asks him if he knows one final name associated with the gang: Hank.\n\nWolverine initially seems to show more hatred towards him than any of the others, explaining that he was the one who sold Wolverine to the gang in the first place. The Chief informs Wolverine that Hank is already dead, thinking he'll be happy to know that, but instead the news only makes Wolverine despondent. He insists that the reason for his sadness is that he didn't get to kill Hank himself, but the Chief doubts this. Hank's cause of death isn't listed, making them suspect that there's more to his case, and decides to end the interrogation to find his place of residence. Wolverine interjects, offering to guide them through the Rust to the exact location, and denies doing this out of any care for Hank. The Chief agrees on the condition that he promises not to harm anyone along the way. He accepts the offer.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Though production supplies are now being provided, Wolverine cares about only survival as he was once trained to be a beast. He knows nothing about the weapon production and arms trade. During the interrogation, an unexpected name came up: Hank. This led to Wolverine's unusual reaction. Strangely enough, it seems Hank's death isn't as simple as it looks. You decided to bring Wolverine to the Rust to investigate the truth behind Hank's death.</i></p>","interrogation2":"The Chief and Wolverine make their way to Hank's tent. Wolverine is intimately familiar with all of his belongings, telling the stories behind each one, and is seemingly looking for something specific. Then a man named Labiche wanders in, apparently knowing Wolverine from the past, and claims to have information about Hank's death. He says that it looked like Hank had been torn apart by Corruptors, a surprising sight given Hank's experience in dealing with the creatures. He refers to Wolverine derisively as a \"little beast,\" saying that Hank got what he deserved for teaching Wolverine to speak, and Wolverine punches him. Wolverine asks him if he thought Hank's death was funny, and Labiche, not understanding why Wolverine reacted so strongly, says he did. Wolverine then proceeds to beat him within an inch of his life, with only the Shackles able to snap him out of his rage.\r\n\r\nThe Chief asks why Wolverine would lash out in defense of Hank despite the fact that Hank sold him in the first place. Wolverine says that while he resents Hank for doing so, Hank was also the only one who ever treated him like a person: feeding him, clothing him, and teaching him. He snaps that Hank would never put him in shackles, and the Chief explains that it was the only way to stop Wolverine from killing Labiche. Wolverine demands to know why he should care, and the Chief tells him that if he wants to not be a dog or a beast, he has to respect ethics and laws -- ultimately, he has to learn to control his emotions. Wolverine doesn't reply, and Hecate arrives with another team upon seeing the red glow of the Shackles. The Chief and Hecate hypothesize that someone might have been controlling the Corruptors, and after Hecate leaves to clean up the scene, Wolverine quietly packs up all of Hank's belongings.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>It seems Wolverine is unexpectedly familiar with the place where Hank used to live. While you were searching for clues, you ran into unpleasant company, Labiche the Scavenger. Labiche revealed information to you that might help you understand the truth behind Hank's death. But in the process, Labiche also insulted Hank, which infuriated Wolverine. You stopped Wolverine from committing an atrocity and taught him how to control his impulse to kill. Also, you finally realized what Hank meant to Wolverine. Hank wasn't his enemy. He was like a father and teacher to him as he was the first to ever treat Wolverine as a human.</i></p>","interrogation3":"The investigation finds a piece of black cloth with excess Mania residue on it and a wolf-tooth necklace with fingerprints matching Wolverine's. Pippy, Wolverine's pet badger, appears from beneath a pile of papers, gesturing for the Chief to go see him. They find him in the Outdoor Activity Area staring off towards the Rust. He apologizes for hitting the Chief in the interrogation room, as well for losing control and attacking Labiche, although his apology seems lacking. The Chief criticizes him for a hollow apology, which Wolverine likens to something Hank might have said. He reminisces on when Hank first adopted him, a scene that plays out in flashback. In it, a young Wolverine bites Hank, who feeds him despite the injury. He teaches Wolverine how to say \"I am sorry,\" his first words.\r\n\r\nIn the present day, Wolverine laughs. The Chief and Pippy are shocked, having never heard Wolverine laugh before, and Wolverine replies that he was thinking back to his youth. Another memory plays out, this time of Hank preventing a young Wolverine from attacking a man that accosted them. Hank tells Wolverine that what separates the boy from an animal is impulse, warning him not to give into his impulsive side. The man asks Hank if he even knows how to spell \"impulsive,\" to which Hank replies that Wolverine can teach him once he's old enough. Wolverine then asks the Chief how to spell \"impulsive,\" only to have their tender moment interrupted by Demolia coming to drag the Chief away for drinks. The Chief invites Wolverine to join them. While initially hesitant, he acquiesces once the Chief reveals the necklace. Wolverine reveals that this was the item he was looking for: the first birthday present Hank ever gave him. He agrees to come along, and with Demolia pushing them onwards, the Chief wonders if Hank regretted his decision to sell Wolverine.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>The cat is finally out of the bag, and you now know what happened between Wolverine and Hank. It doesn't matter anymore whether it was a story of heart-warming friendship or bitter grudges. All the answers were settled as Hank's life faded away. But Wolverine's life must carry on. You retrieved the Wolf Tooth Necklace from Hank and gave it to Wolverine, hoping that this boy who was once a beast could become a real human.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"Violently resisted during the arrest and was captured using the electricity grid.

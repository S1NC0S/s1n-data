She remembers nothing from the 23 years that she was inside the illusory realm, and is fearful and confused at her surroundings and the passage of time. She sees the pendant that the Chief had given her, and uses her ability to conjure an illusion of [[[List of Minor Characters |Norman]]], who she reveals to be her younger brother, greatly aged by the Black Ring while she stayed the same age. The illusions replay memories of Norman working to protect Hamel, so that she wouldn't have to dance, ultimately becoming so overwhelmed by the stresses of his life that he was drawn to the Carnival at the beginning of BR-001. Hamel went ahead of him, awakened as a Sinner, and created the illusory realm in order to keep him out, never imagining that he would continue to linger on the edge of the Ring for so long.\n\nThe Chief encourages Hamel to move on now that she has been freed from the illusory realm, but a phantom jellyfish appears and taunts her, saying that she can't be freed until she acknowledges why it is that she wanted to stay and dance for the Corruptors in the Rust even after the Ring and Norman were gone. Hamel begins to go Manic until the Chief uses the Shackles to force her to dispel the illusion. Due to her mental state, they are forced to pause the interrogation.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Norman was not the main reason why Hamel insisted on staying in the Carnival. Then what was haunting her? Hamel doesn't seem to remember the answer, either. Due to her unstable condition and mood swings, you have to stop interrogation for now.</i></p>","interrogation2":"Through the Shackles, the Chief witnesses Hamel dreaming of a past performance. When she goes out on stage, she freezes and the audience jeers her, but her mother, who wants Hamel's career to bring her wealth, forces her to begin to dance. Hamel reveals that ever since the [[[DisSea Explosion]]], she has been able to hear all the songs of sadness in the world, and finds it horrible to dance happily while surrounded by so much sadness; nevertheless, audiences only want to see her dance as a form of joyful escapism. The phantom jellyfish appears again; Hamel collapses on stage, and the phantom asks again why she chose to stay in the Black Ring, and tells her that only by going back to her stage at the center of the lake can she find what she truly desires. Hamel remembers the taunts of her human audiences, the demands of her family, and the adoration of the Corruptors and puppets in the Black Ring.\n\nThe Chief awakens, having realized that the reason Hamel stayed in the Black Ring was because only the Corruptors, who have experienced the depths of despair, appreciate the dance that Hamel wants to express. They go to explain this to her, but discover that Hamel has escaped the prison, and is on her way back to the site of the Carnival, with all the Corruptors in the Rust again responding to her presence and converging on her location.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>She was a diverting plaything for the audience, a tool for her mother to make profit, a Dancer that has brought comfort to Corruptors, and now... She is a Sinner that has escaped and must be brought back.</i></p>","interrogation3":"The MBCC forces catch up to Hamel a kilometer from the Carnival, but the Chief orders them to keep their distance and not to harm her. The phantom jellyfish appears again and engulfs them in a deep-sea illusion, separating them from Hamel. The Chief tells it that they understand what her feelings and are trying to help her get what she wants, but the phantom says that too many people have lied to her like that, and she has stopped believing. The Chief does not want to fight the phantom, knowing that it is only a part of Hamel, but as she begins to dance for the assembling Corruptors again, they resolve to use the Shackles. The illusory world dampens their power, but the Chief is able to convince the phantom that they don't want to use the Shackles to restrain Hamel, but to keep her safe so that she can dance without risk of Mania, which makes them a better audience than the Corruptors are. The phantom dispels the illusion, and the Chief goes ahead alone to bring back Hamel.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>To fulfill the wish in Hamel's innermost heart, to let her dance freely what she wants to dance, to accept her for what she truly is... All this time, you have been standing firm to your ground, whether it's facing controversy from the past, or her elusive emotions that have taken a physical shape.</i></p>","interrogation4":"Hamel and the Chief walk through the ruins of the Carnival, and the Chief tells her about what happened in the Black Ring. Hamel expresses sympathy toward all the enemies that they fought, hoping that the puppets are now at peace and saying that she should be the one envious of the false Hamel, because it at least knew what it wanted. They reach the site of the lake where Hamel danced, and find that without the illusions, it is just a stretch of empty land. Hamel regains her memories of meeting the Chief in the Ring and asks them to dance with her. Their dance creates the illusion of a warm spring day, allowing Hamel to finally dance joyfully in a way she never could before.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>With your guidance, she has recalled you, and seen the stars.\nYou dance in the together in the radiant spring, to your hearts' content.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"The Chief was commissioned to go to the endless carnival and suppress BR-001 Black Ring, and in the process successfully arrested Hamel, the first Sinner who revealed their identity as a Sinner. Since the subject was trapped in the illusion for many years, she was immediately taken in and provided psychiatric treatment after contamination from the Black Ring was removed.","arrestRec2":"Parents were working agents to train the subject to become a famous dancer. Tired of the over-frequent commercial events, the subject had a poor relationship with both parents and was closer to her brother, Norman. After the siblings ran away, the parents disappeared with the money to escape their debts.","arrestRec3":"The subject got famous with just one dance at the age of sixteen, and rose to the commercial and artistic peak in DisCity with the help of her parents and talent. She escaped with her younger brother, Norman, due to stage fright, but reappeared a few years later in the endless carnival event.","arrestRec4":"The investigation found that the BR-001 Black Ring inventor was someone else. The subject sacrificed personal freedom to confine the Corruptors and suppress the Black Ring after finding out the anomalies in the endless carnival, which effectively stopped the spread of danger. Convicted of collective disappearance by the FAC, but is still debatable whether the subject is guilty of committing a crime.","servingTerm1":"Lacks the concept of time due to being trapped in illusions for over a decade. The youthful state of her personality and body have been kept by unknown influences. Extremely uncomfortable with real life. Often found zoning out and unresponsive to external stimuli.","servingTerm2":"The dance costume has the same design as the one the subject wore in the last performance. The material test showed that she was wearing a silk nightgown at home, and what the people saw was an illusion created by her special power.","servingTerm3":"Being the \"first recognized Sinner,\" the MBCC was worried that she would be ostracized, but instead, people crowded around Hamel's room, wanting to see the legendary dancer.","servingTerm4":"Hamel can communicate with the Chief smoothly now. The two are said to often dance together in the cell to communicate. The Chief's act of appreciating artistic treasure exclusively without sharing has been strongly condemned.","emotionCheck1":"[Hamel trips on something in the bedroom.]\r\n\r\n**Hamel:** Help… The bedroom… I cannot practice my dance moves there.

This drove her to the edge, leading her to lash out at the top brass. She might have cooled down since, but the whispers say she's plotting something big and dangerous.\n\n--\n\nUpon the Chief's deep dive, it's clear that the subject's been brainwashed, now puppeteered by some shadowy figure from Paradeisos. This sinister influence led her to throw wrenches in our investigations and even lash out at Chief. But there's hope. Thanks to Chief's shackle abilities, this mind grip is loosening.

The latter sums up Chief’s report as follows: that Chief believes [[[Nirvana]]], or someone behind them, was the driving force behind the N.F. 104  and N.F. 113 [[[Rustfire]]] and [[[BR-002]]] crises. Chief explains that they merely want the truth, and the 9th Agency member comments that everyone wants the truth, but few can afford the price. He tells Chief to pay attention to the new arrival Rahu, and hands Chief some documents before leaving.\n\nChief and Rahu meet in the interrogation room. Upon questioning, Rahu begins listing her personal information: she was recruited by the [[[framework against catastrophe |FAC]]] in N.F. 102 and worked for them until she was transferred to the [[[minos bureau of crisis control |MBCC]]] last week. Rahu claims to not remember the name of the captain who recruited her,  but Chief knows it is a lie as Rahu joined that captain’s squad, and Rahu had even caused a scene to know the truth about [[[Operation Eclipse]]] (where she was the lone survivor). Rahu claims that she went through PTSD treatment at the FAC, and can no longer remember certain things. Chief changes the topic, asking her why she went to Erica Villa in July N.F. 113. Rahu states that she went there on vacation. Chief refutes it, and Rahu admits she received a distress signal on the public channel and responded, and that she knew a [[[paradeisos |Paradeisian]]] official was at the villa beforehand. However, she once again lies, saying that her goal was to get a job working for a Paradeisian instead of the dangerous FAC.\n\nChief begins to put the pieces together about Rustfire and that “big shot” Paradeisian ([[[Shalom]]]), wondering why they would send Rahu to the MBCC now. Rahu threatens Chief, warning them not to dig further. Unnerved but calm, Chief thanks Rahu for the advice and mentions they will not end up like [[[list of minor characters |Conrad Cage]]], her former Captain. The name stirs a reaction in Rahu; Chief informs her that Conrad was involved in another disastrous mission and was the only survivor of their entire squad G47 (besides Rahu, who was at Erica Villa). Rahu seems genuinely shocked by the revelation, and agrees to go see him.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>No matter what Rahu’s motive is, there is something strange about her attitude towards Conrad Cage.\n\nThe visit to him will be key to uncovering the truth about Rahu.</i></p>\n","interrogation2":"An FAC soldier posted outside Conrad’s cell states that he was once a good, respectable leader, but has now turned insane from [[[Mania]]]. He asks Chief to try and save him.\n\nConrad is in terrible shape. He sees Rahu and begins yelling at her, accusing her of becoming a Paradeisos lapdog. He says that he had thought Rahu was crazy after her experience in Operation Eclipse, but now realises that she had been right. Chief talks Conrad down, and Conrad says he has proof that Pradeisos killed [[[list of minor characters |Varna]]], the Captain who recruited Rahu, and sent FAC units on suicide missions for nothing. Rahu says the evidence is all fabricated and tells Conrad to hand it over, and Conrad screams that she was the one who had collected the evidence. Rahu subdues him calmly, but Chief feels the [[[Shackles]]] reacting to her rising anger within. Conrad regrets allowing Rahu to go to Erica Villa alone, asking what they had done to the real Rahu. \n\nConrad’s Mania starts to infect Rahu, and Chief imposes a prohibition on her to stand aside. For an instant, Chief sees absolute fury in Rahu’s eyes, and they realise that this has provoked an insight to the real her. With his Mania subdued, Conrad reaches for Chief’s hand; Chief realises he is sending them a code with his taps, “Ornstein 47 301”. Chief and Rahu leave. Rahu had noticed Conrad trying to pass a message, and asks Chief about it. She advises Chief to keep it a secret for their own safety, and it becomes apparent that Rahu is genuinely concerned for Chief’s wellbeing, and attempting to protect Conrad through Chief. Rahu once again warns Chief not to cross the line in search of the truth, and the Chief asks if that is the order of her real master. Rahu roundaboutly says that it is. \n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Without a doubt, Rahu cares a lot about Conrad. After the visit, every conversation you have revolves around her asking you to protect Conrad.\n\nWhat is she hiding? And who is she hiding it from? You don’t know for now.</i></p>\n","interrogation3":"The Chief has gone out looking for the evidence Conrad mentioned, knowing that Rahu will soon arrive as well. In what appears to be Rahu’s diary, she mentions the Rustfire riots on April 5, and her determination to become a [[[Sinner]]]. She had injected herself with Mania crystals on April 9 and after three days of unconsciousness, became a Sinner by April 12, much to Conrad’s dismay. As a powerful Sinner, she was given authorization to act freely. The other entries clearly show her determination to get closer to the higher-ups and the truth, even trying to meet with Paradeisians by responding to distress signals.\n\nChief considers the strange sensation the Shackles detected in Rahu (likely Shalom’s [[[Mark]]]), as well as the inconsistency between the diary and the current Rahu. As the thunder sounds, Rahu appears as expected and threatens Chief for digging where they should not have. Chief reveals that they had set up the scene on purpose so that no one could eavesdrop on them and they could speak honestly. Chief provokes her with mention of Conrad, causing her to finally drop the mask and plainly, sadly tell Chief to stay in the light of safety. A gunshot fires, and [[[HUSH]]] units appear. They claim to have a mission: to destroy everything related to “her” -- referring to their former commander, Shalom. The HUSH units tell Rahu to prove her reliability by executing Conrad, and Rahu attempts to reject it by stating her role is that of a guard, not a destroyer. The HUSH units state that during Shalom’s confinement, Rahu serves as a reference on her condition: Rahu’s betrayal means Shalom’s betrayal. However, Rahu cannot bear to let Chief get harmed or to die meaninglessly there herself, and takes a battle stance.\n\nChief loudly protests, throwing Rahu’s knife at the leading HUSH unit. Rahu attempts to speak, but Chief imposes a prohibition on her and begins acting as though Rahu is being forced to follow their orders. They also claim that Rahu attacked them, and HUSH tries to warn the Chief to back down. The Chief bites back that the unit is clearly useless to Paradeisos without a Hush to lead them, hence why they have been trying to test Rahu in such a roundabout way; they have not actually received orders from Paradeisos.  Chief proclaims that they want their revenge for how Paradeisos treated them throughout the Rustfire crisis, and that they are forcing an order through the shackles on Rahu. She is unleashed and destroys the HUSH units.\n\nAfter the fight, the Chief says the records will show the entire situation was all their fault, once again asking Rahu to let them help her; Rahu is on edge about the Chief's brazen approach to this conflict, but they tell her that sometimes, there is no need to be too prudent as some people will suspect them no matter what they do. Chief uses the shackles to calm Rahu's Mania levels, and finds that the strange obstacle (the Mark) has disappeared. \n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Rain Burst into dreams.</i></p>","interrogation4":"In Rahu's dreams, she flashes back to her time as an FAC soldier. She placed protecting her comrades above anything else, especially her Captain, Varna. On one mission, her injuries from protecting Varna were so serious that it would take her three months to heal. Later on, Varna invited Rahu and Conrad to her home for dinner. Varna tells Rahu that she wants her to lead Squad G47 in the event of her death, but Rahu plainly refuses, stating Varna will lead, and Rahu will protect her. Rahu confesses that she fears being left alone. Shalom then appears in Rahu’s consciousness, and Rahu notes that Shalom has pulled some tricks to help her remember the past. Shalom points out that Rahu has someone now and Rahu thanks her, but Shalom returns the sentiment and tells Rahu to go for her goal of finding the truth.\n\nRahu wakes, and immediately leaps up with a million questions, searching for her weapon to defend Chief. Chief calms her down and begins to explain. She was unconscious for four days, and Chief made a fuss with the 9th Agency and FAC about the Hush unit's attack, demanding to meet their commander. Chief’s boss (most likely [[[Langley]]]) just gave them an earful, and the higher-ups did not do anything to punish Chief as they were technically in the right for defending themselves against the rogue elites. Chief also used the opportunity to demand compensation, asking for a huge amount of resources and supplies for the MBCC. \n\nSobering up, Chief informs Rahu that Paradeisos wants to transfer her back to their command, and Rahu decides to leave the MBCC in order to gain information and pay back Chief for their protection. Rahu departs, promising to always protect Chief from the shadows.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Rahu left the MBCC after that day.\n\nSometimes she would vanish without a trace, while other times she would pop up to meet you.\n\nYou believe that one day, she will achieve her goal and relieve herself of her burden… Then, she would return to the MBCC with the intelligence and “Paradeisos connections” you want.\n\nRahu, Conrad, and every person who has given their all for this city… none of them are alone.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"After the events of Erica Villa, the subject disappeared without a trace.

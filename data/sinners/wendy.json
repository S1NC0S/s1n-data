The subject often wandered aimlessly with a chainsaw and has committed dozens of assaults. Highly aggressive and almost unable to interact with others. The unpredictable behavior and chilling laughter have incited terror among the DisCity civilians.\n\nRelevant information has clearly been purposefully erased and the identity is highly suspicious.\n\n--\n\nIt's now been confirmed that a government-owned secret squad in charge of contamination purification existed several years ago. As a member of the squad, the subject accidentally discovered the secret deal between her captain and Syndican government officials. This greatly shook her beliefs and the rage awakened her special power.\n\nThe Syndican government later dismissed her and erased records of the squad. Having been exiled to the Rust, the subject still performs her long-lifted cleaning duties and fights against Corruptors and monsters with her chainsaw","mutationAssessment":"+++* Ability Summary\r\nAble to further enhance the equipped chainsaw with the ability, granting it even more dangerous destructive power. Rumor has it that the subject's special power can convert any weapon in hand into a chainsaw of the same size, but this saying is still to be verified.\r\n\r\n+++* Awakening Signs\r\nThe source of contamination is deduced to be the large number of Corruptor remains in the Rust. The subject had been in close contact with the contamination in the Rust and a mental shock triggered the awakening after a long incubation period of years.\r\n\r\n+++* Corruption State\r\nThe corruption level is high. Out of all the symptoms, the mental damage is the most severe. She goes into an uncontrollable frenzy when exposed to certain stimulation.","ecbFlavourText":"\"The Undertaker must never violate her own creed.\"","interrogation1":"In the FAC's ongoing attempt to determine the source of the Mania weapons flooding [[[Syndicate]]], they tracked the origin of the crystals used in their production to the Rust. Wendy was apprehended in an operation to round up a body-snatching ring that sells the corpses of [[[Corruptor |Corruptors]]] for the extraction of Mania crystals. She gleefully admits to the charges brought against her and nonsensically alludes to it being a \"mission\" given to her and her \"companions\". The Chief struggles to extract useful information from her rambling delusions, but eventually Wendy produces a chain made of dog tags and says that they belong to her companions. Seeing the quality of the metal and the advanced encryption used to hide the information on the tags, the Chief initially fears that an until-now unknown but elite and systemized organization has control of the Rust, but as Wendy continues to ramble they realize that the tags contain technology that belongs to the FAC.\n\nThe Chief looks into the information on the tags and reveals that Wendy was once a member of an FAC Catastrophe Contamination Cleanup Squad called Mortician, also known as the Undertakers. The squad collectively abandoned their duty, and every member of the Undertakers was killed and the unit abolished. July 1, NF 110, the FAC established an investigation team, but due to the deaths of all members suspected of violating the rules, the investigation was aborted and the unit was abolished. June 30 NF 110, the undertakers experienced a violent attack on their stronghold at the Rust, which was completely destroyed. Their remains were not able to be recovered, but every member, including Wendy, was confirmed dead the following year.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Wendy very likely has something to do with the smuggling case's supply transport. But at the same time, you become aware of an even more surprising fact: Wendy once served under the FAC's forces.\nBut the problem is, documents show that all personnel of such forces were dead long ago.\nYou decide to take Wendy to the Rust on a secret mission.</i></p>","interrogation2":"The Chief and [[[Nightingale]]] receive an order from the FAC to bring Wendy back to the Rust as a decoy in order to investigate the corpse stealers, whom they believe to be fellow surviving Undertakers. However, when they find corpse stealers at work, they are revealed to be members of [[[Black Water]]]. Under attack by Wendy, they try to make a corrupt deal with the Chief, saying that it wouldn't be the first time -- their boss previously had a deal with the captain of the Undertakers, which he made because their squad was woefully underequipped by the FAC for the dangerous work that they were doing. In order to preserve the chain of evidence, the Chief stops Wendy from killing the body thieves, and she turns on them instead in rage that they would betray her, cutting into their shoulder with her chainsaw. The Chief stops Nightingale from calling a sniper hit on Wendy, and is able to talk her down by promising that they believe her about her old friends and companions. The fate of the Undertakers remains largely a mystery.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>You didn't expect the Undertaker to be such a miserable organization. And it surprises you how Wendy and her companions shared such a dark past...\nBelieving that Wendy is innocent in this event, you risk getting yourself hurt to stop Wendy from taking it out on those two corpse vendors and slaughtering them.</i></p>\n","interrogation3":"Wendy explains that the Undertakers were all people with no future, who were given the job of cleaning up corruption because they had nothing left for the contamination to take from them. She saw the mission they were given as a great purpose, and her captain's deal with the corpse thieves as a deep betrayal of their ideals. Even after learning that their so-called \"great task\" was viewed as disposable by those above and she succumbed to Mania, she continued to follow her original mission of disposing of Corruptors and preventing the spread of contamination from the Rust.\n\nWendy takes the Chief to see her companions, and although she talks about them as if they are simply sleeping, the Chief finds only a row of shallow graves -- with one open grave at the end, which Wendy dug for herself and sleeps in every night to be with them. She refuses to let the Chief remove their graves, even though the corpse thieves already have their eyes on them, but the Chief is able to convince her that if she stays with them, there will be nobody to lay her to rest like she did for all her friends. They promise to her new companion from now on, until it is time for her to sleep as well.\n\n<p style=\"color:white\"><i>Wendy brings you to see her friends and family, but you realize that they are in an eternal slumber next to the Rust, never to wake up again.\nYou decide to become Wendy's companion and share her fate and sorrow as an Undertaker so that she can rely on you always.</i></p>","arrestRec1":"During the investigation of a Mania Weapon deal, the subject was spotted at the scene of a raw material transaction. The subject was arrested after her Sinner identity was confirmed. Appearing furious and difficult to subdue, the subject was injected with a huge dose of sedative and then successfully captured.","arrestRec2":"Abandoned as an infant by the Rust. The subject's biological parents' identities can no longer be determined. Survived miraculously amid Corruptor remains. With an unknown infection level, the subject was rejected by all orphanages and taken in by the cleanup unit that had saved the subject.","arrestRec3":"Lived with the unit before being adopted and is believed to have engaged in high-risk work involving direct contact with Corruptor contamination. Detailed information about the unit has been erased and query access to relevant information is limited.","arrestRec4":"The subject had been part of the //Undertakers// team and buried dozens of teammates during that period. The former team leader betrayed the team by engaging in Corruptor smuggling and was purged by the subject when the truth was exposed. Afterward, the Undertakers went out of control under the subject's leadership. The team was expelled by the FAC and all of their achievements and records were erased.","servingTerm1":"The subject has demonstrated impressive skills and experience on several Corruptor cleanup missions, but hasn't been able to calm down after the battles, remaining in a delirious state for a long period and only regaining sanity with the help of psychiatric medication. After taking the medicine, the subject would stare in the direction of the Rust with a blank expression.","servingTerm2":"Will avoid touching the bloodstains on the blade when maintaining the chainsaw. According to the subject, these old bloodstains have an important meaning, so even though they've made the blade all rusty, the subject refuses to replace it.","servingTerm3":"The subject has a fragmented and chaotic speech pattern and a capricious mind that are difficult to make sense of. But during a few exchanges, the subject has addressed other Sinners by the names of the late teammates, possibly a way of expressing the subject's trust and sense of belonging for MBCC.","servingTerm4":"A doodle was found in the subject's room on which a crooked and abstractly shaped double grave is drawn, with the subject and the Chief's names written on the headstone.","emotionCheck1":"[Wendy tears the document into pieces.]\r\n\r\n**Wendy:** The Corruptorsâ¦.

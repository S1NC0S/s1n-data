Generally, Angell's breaking prowess is outshone by B-rank Labyrinth, and her burst dmg/long battle dps is replaceable by other Physical DPS such as Mantis, Dreya, etc. If there are a lacking number of Cored enemies, Angell will struggle to effectively stack [Blade Shade], adversely affecting her burst, and unlike Mantis/Deren, Angell's Ult is not able to Crit. Angell uniquely benefits from the apperance of high Core enemies and excels on high Core maps since she gains energy and [Blade Shade] stacks whenever enemies simply lose a Core, allowing her to Ult more often and deal more damage with Ult. However, since other Sinners would also be able to make use of the surplus energy provided by the appearance of extra enemies with Cores, despite being superior in such an enivornment, Angell is rendered unneccessary in her own niche."},{"title":"Key Shackles","text":"**S0:** Angell is useable at S0.    \n\r**S1:** With S1, Angell's Ult deals two additional instances of damage without consuming [Blade Shade] stacks, significantly increasing Angell's Ult dmg.

Eventually, they see an anonymous post offering intel about her whereabouts. They buy the information, which leads them to find her collapsed from weakness in a Syndicate alley. The Chief brings her back to the MBCC, where she eats her first meal in a long time. After eating, Angell gets up to leave, but she agrees to stay for a conversation with the Chief. They explain how they found her, and then ask for assistance clearing up some details of the prior assassination cases that the Chief needs for their report. Angell confirms that at the end of her time with the Chief, she leaked information about them in order to bait out the killers, and that on the days when she disappeared for \"personal business\" she was actually hunting the masterminds behind the assassinations. The Chief thanks her for protecting them, but Angell dismisses it, saying that she was only following her instructions to hold and guard the MBCC Chief until delivery. The two of them wonder at why Angell's mission would have been to kidnap rather than kill the Chief, and theorize that somebody tampered with the contract. While Angell is a regular user of DisMyth, she says that she doesn't know anything about its creator or the technology it uses to hide itself, or who could possibly be capable of hacking its byzantine defenses. \n\nThe Chief turns the conversation to Angell, and she explains that after the last mission, some on DisMyth believed that she had betrayed her client and gone over to the authorities. She has been followed by them constantly ever since, unable to return to her safehouse or do other jobs to make money, and thus was slowly worn down until she collapsed. However, she also says that she really didn't do anything except follow the letter of her contract, and so once she deals with these pursuers, her credibility on the dark web will only increase. Angell makes to leave again and says that she will repay this kindness once she can, but the Chief suggests that she can repay it now by spending a little more time with them. The Chief has a few days off ahead of them, and hopes that by showing her a bit of normal life, they can change Angell's mind about staying in the darkness.\n\n//After verifying some uncertain details of a previous case with Angell and learning about how she's been doing, you decide to show her \"the sunlit world\" in a different way and plan an outdoor day off with her.//","interrogation2":"Angell is surprised to learn that on the Chief's days off, they like to operate a vegetable stand at a farmer's market in Syndicate. The Chief explains that they have long fantasized about living a normal life in the West District, and they have a good laugh that none of the customers would ever imagine that they're buying produce from a dark web hitman and the hero of [[[BR-002]]]. Unfortunately, Angell's intense presence scares away most of the market patrons, and business is slow.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the market, a group of thugs begin harassing stall owners and shaking them down for protection money. These lowlifes, mainly people who were shunned from or too weak to join a real gang, see a chance to seize some power in Syndicate now that the major gangs have all been forced into hiding. While the winds have indeed changed in Syndicate, the thugs are surprised to find that the shift is not in their favor. The regular people at the market resist their demands, and the thugs become angry. Just before the situation breaks into violence, Angell intervenes and forces them to flee. The celebratory crowd mobs her and the Chief with thanks and quickly buys out the entire stock of their vegetable stall. With nothing else to sell, the Chief suggest that the two of them take the rest of the day to spend their earnings.\r\n\r\n//You and Angell come to a newly established farmers' market in West District, becoming one of the many vendors. \r\nBusiness is initially slow, but after Angell deals with some troublemaking thugs, your vegetable stall is swept clean by the cheering crowd.//","interrogation3":"The Chief brings Angell to the cinema, where they watch a movie dramatizing the events of the [[[Rustfire]]] rebellion and BR-002. The Chief is amused by how cleaned up and heroic the climax is made to be, in comparison to the messy and desperate battle that took place in real life, but they enjoy the flick as it causes them to reflect on how far the West District has come. Angell is less impressed by the theme of people striving for a better future, and insists to the Chief that unlike the characters in the movie, she's totally content with the life that she has now. The Chief convinces her to tell them about her past, and Angell relates that she did once try to leave behind her work on the dark web. After only three months, her enemies tracked her down and murdered the owners of a restaurant that she frequented. The Chief offers their sympathies, but Angell replies that this was actually not a sad moment for her. Rather, she felt liberated by these events, as it caused her to realize that trying to run away from her history was no better than embracing her dangerous lifestyle. After that, she was able to live comfortably in the city's dark side without missing a \"normal\" life. \r\n\r\nThe Chief is stunned by this revelation and, for once, can think of nothing to say to her. Angell sympathetically reaches out to them and says that she knows the Chief is used to having to save people, but that this is one time when the person near them doesn't need their help. No matter how many times they ask her, they will not convince her to leave her life behind. Finally, the Chief relents. They apologize for being stubborn and selfish by ignoring her wishes, but it shakes their beliefs that everybody lost in the darkness is yearning for a better life.\r\n\r\n//The movie themed around the Drifter Camp and Rustfire evokes many emotions and memories in you. You try to subtly persuade Angell to start a new life like the characters in the film. Angell responds by sharing her past, making it clear she belongs in darkness and the underworld, with no chance of coming back under the sunlight.//","interrogation4":"Angell spends one last night at the MBCC, but she has an uncharacteristically difficult time falling asleep. She reflects on the time that she spent with the Chief, both during the three weeks at her safehouse and over the past day. Angell is aware that she is bad at expressing herself, and thinks that she wasn't able to fully explain her feelings to the Chief. She worries that she upset them with what she said that afternoon, and resolves to make her thoughts clear the next day. \r\n\r\nIn the morning, Angell meets the Chief at the Bureau's exit gate. They give her a thermal bag of food to go and explain all the ways that they have maintained and stocked up her safehouse for her. Their tone is gentle and lighthearted, but Angell very seriously insists that there's something she needs to say to them. She tells the Chief that she didn't choose not to stay with them because she dislikes them or the life they offered; just like the Chief, she cherishes the time that they spent together. The reason she won't stay is that she fears how her past might hurt the Chief is she spends too much time with them, and also that becoming too accustomed to an easier life would make it harder for her to survive. She is indeed happy the way she is now, but thanks them for showing her that there is a way to remain in the darkness, but also help protect the people who live under the sun. The Chief earnestly understands her feelings, and replies that Angell has showed them that the same \"universal rules\" for how to live can't be applied to everybody. But they also say that Angell is wrong about one thing: the Chief is stronger than she thinks, and Angell isn't so dangerous that she should worry about how she might harm them. The Chief promises to stop bothering her from now on, but before leaving, Angell makes them promise not to leave her alone completely.\r\n\r\nSome time later, Angell contacts a mysterious digital presence on DisMyth. She calls this figure the only one capable of hacking the dark web and accuses them of being the one who tampered with her original orders and gave her location to the Chief. Angell guesses that the presence wants to go to the Chief, but can't. It confirms that it is watching the Chief and wants to reach them, but can't do so yet; it says that the dark web has changed somehow, but it thinks it will get to the Chief very soon.\r\n\r\n//You may be destined to return to your separate worlds due to your differences, but the farewell needs not be final. You can always look forward to the next reunion.//"}
